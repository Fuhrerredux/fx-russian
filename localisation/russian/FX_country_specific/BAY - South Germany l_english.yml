## Focus Descriptions ##
BAY_left_wing_desc: "With the fall of the Reich, the German proletariat at last have broken their chains and launched the long-in-exile German Socialists to power. Now that the Homeland of the Revolution has been reclaimed, what will come next?"
BAY_congress_desc: "As the new government settles in, we've got much to figure out. However, one of the big issues currently at hand is our leadership. Although Eisner has proven to be the sort of revolutionary leader Germany needs, new blood is neccessary to sustain the people's state. Hence, the First Peoples' Congress of the South German Union shall be called!"
BAY_totalists_desc: "In a shock to many, it seems that Wolffheim's lackeys in South Germany have won out. Perhaps due to the humiliation of Germany's division, or maybe the fear struck into the government and populace by the White Terror. Nonetheless, National Revolutionaries now control South Germany and all that remains is to observe the consequences."
BAY_restrict_free_speech_desc: "Whilst we may have granted power back to the German proletariat, it still seems subversive elements infest our ranks. The German proletariat are thus in danger, forcing us to crack down on these elements to save the Germans from being brainwashed by the machinations of malicious aliens and traitors."   
BAY_clamp_down_on_cosmopolitans_desc: "Even though our crackdown has successfully saved Germans everywhere from being misled, it seems that the biggest threat still looms. Reactionaries of the cultural kind prepare to suck German pride out of the proletariat, and as such they must rooted out and neutralized with the utmost vigor."
BAY_encourage_nationalism_desc: "Although our state may be in many ways unnatural, we can still all relate to a shared heritage of Germany. In essence, we must create a new German Nation. We must therefore at once bring in those who are sympathetic, emboldening the German People with renewed vigor and vitality."
BAY_remove_false_revolutionaries_desc: "Like it or not, we have been forced to share some of our government's power with the irksome Internationalists and their whiny Moderate allies. We must immediately censure these dissidents, hopefully sending the message that one cannot bargain with the foreigners."
BAY_national_revolution_desc: "Even though we have fought like hell to restore Germany to its greater state of being, there remains much to do. From the division of our lands to our enforced servitude to our occupiers, the German people have their work cut out for them.\nYet despite all of that, Germany has to fight today for the freedom of its unfree-born children, for a future home for its homeless, for the future hopeless generations."
BAY_radical_socialists_desc: "With the end of the First Congress, it seems that South Germany has elected to follow the moderate way to socialism. The moderate wing of the KAPD have won out over the radicals and it remains to be seen how South Germany will react to this development."
BAY_defang_nationalists_desc: "Whilst we have set off on the quest for socialism, we have encountered many hiccups on the way. Warmongers especially who emphazize petty nationalism over the real international struggle. Thus, we must crack down on these elements and censure them for now."
BAY_convert_the_church_desc: "Eckert's former status as a Lutheran Pastor in Mannheim has made him seem far more tolerable than the rest of the KAPD to many of our religious comrades. We should thus use this and bring in the Church as a tool to bring about socialism throughout South Germany. After all, was not Jesus the first socialist?"
BAY_peaceful_revolution_desc: "Whilst some of our comrades believe that only violent struggle can lead the workers to liberation, this has not necessarily been proven true. We should hence tread lightly and slowly bring in those who are either skeptical or unaware of the revolution's benefits."
BAY_welfare_for_people_desc: "How can a Socialist State last without the proletariat? Even as doctrinaires and cynics duke it out over the intricacies of Marxist theory, workers starve in the streets as the people lay in their ruined towns and cities. This must end! We must thus be hands-on and save the people from hopeless destitude."
BAY_christian_socialist_moment_desc: "As the people get on back with their lives and the situation in South Germany returns to normalcy, we must realize that much still remains to be completed and many reactionaries to be dealt with.\nStill, we can at least ease in those who are most innocent yet ignorant about their plight. Only through Socialism can Germany and the world at large be brought to peace and unity."
BAY_syndicalists_desc: "Perhaps to no one's surprise, the Orthodox faction of the KAPD have successfully held their own against both extremists and moderates. With Eisner being in his late 70s, many predict that he'll be stepping down and soon, Ernst Toller will assume the position as Chairman of the KAPD. Still, his relative inexperience leave many doubtful whether the 'South German Revolution of Love' will last."
BAY_revolutionary_democracy_desc: "Whilst milquetoast liberals may moan that our revolutionary statelet is authoritarian, their vision of democracy is far from the real democracy that we've implemented. In the new revolutionary system, the workers exercise their power through the party with the state ultimately withering away. Before that time comes however, we must do all we can to protect our revolutionary system from reactionaries."
BAY_attack_reactionaries_desc: "Even as we set on the path towards communism, it seems that there are still many who are too ignorant to realize what lies ahead. Now, reactionaries will be the one who fears the revolutionary power of the workers, alongside their treacherous conservative friends and monarchist bootlickers."
BAY_question_of_industry_desc: "As Syndicalists who follow the Parisian line, we must remember that only through the urban classes can the revolutionary state evolve towards communism. However, South Germany has far more peasants and landlords than our theoreticians have hoped, and hence we must deal with them at once."
BAY_nationalism_and_consequences_desc: "Whilst we are on-paper internationalists, few can deny that the current South German state exists as an unnatural state that fails to lend internationalism legitimacy. However, the alternative nationalist answer comes with its own bag of worms and thus we must decide on whether or not to take in elements of German nationalism."
BAY_revolution_marches_on_desc: "Few can deny that much has been done, from Stuttgart to Nuremberg, Syndicalism has truly brought the German proletariat into a new age...\nAnd yet there is still much to be done. From the legitimacy of the South German state to the difficulties in bringing syndicalism to the farmers of Germany, we've got a long way to go. Nonetheless, we must always remember how we got here.\nWorkers of the World, Unite!"
BAY_strengthen_the_red_army_desc: "Although the South German Red Army has done much in maintaining order and security, they still suffer from major difficulties. With the stabilization of the government however, we can finally reinforce the brave soldiers who protect us from capitalist terror."
BAY_the_general_problem_desc: "The High Command is INFESTED with reactionaries!\nThis is not a mere exaggeration. From officers who formerly swore allegiance to Wittelsbach to far-right sympathizers working in the General Staff, there are simply too many unreliable officers. Now however, we can afford to bring the army into the revolutionary fold."
BAY_socialist_education_desc: "For too long, children across Germany have had their brain rotted away through capitalist education. Now however, children throughout South Germany can learn the truth and prepare to lead Germany into the future."
BAY_the_commune_question_desc: "Under the new system, communes have been allowed to form so as to let the people decide their own fates. However, their continued existence has given our government many difficulties in enforcing our rule over the still somewhat hostile people of South Germany. Now that we have more resources however, we can finally deal with these thorns in our sides once and for all."
BAY_bring_in_social_democrats_desc: "Back in the days of the tyrannical Kaiser, us and those that now make up today's social democrats were united in the SPD. Unfortunately, they were too scared to bring the revolution to Germany and as a consequence, we and the SPD are now bitter enemies. However, we can use our current position to 'gracefully' bring in these misguided revolutionaries and set them upon the path to proper socialism."
BAY_united_front_desc: "Although we are all in agreement on the nature of the socialist state, it seems that very few of our comrades agree on how to get there. No more! With the SPD brought in, we can now bring the hammer down on the petty factions who oppose us and create the grand socialist united front that the proletariat deserve."
BAY_remove_social_inequality_desc: "Even as the revolution continues to bring all of South Germany into a golden age, it seems that there are still those who keep their heads in the past. To end this backwards way of thinking, we must at once remove the artifacts that arose from the labels invented to divide the working class."
BAY_taking_wealth_desc: "Even though the bourgeoisie have been mostly evicted from their stolen property, they still have in their possession an obscene amount of wealth. Although the backlash may be severe, their unearned wealth will do much better to contribute to the continuation and ultimate success of the revolution"
BAY_centrist_wing_desc: "With the fall of the Reich, the people of South Germany have been thrown into a frenzy as many fear what comes next. Luckily for them, it seems that responsible government will take hold of the nation, at least for now..."
BAY_the_democratic_constitution_desc: "With the situation winding down to the point where a civilian government can be reasonably be made, perhaps it is time for a democratic government. However, the fact that we were pulled straight out of Germany where we belong has forced us to create a new constituition. All we can hope for is that it'll go well..."
BAY_the_monarchy_question_desc: "Considering his position as the former King of Bavaria, Rupperecht has undoubtedly proved extremely troublesome. His wide support base among conservatives thus puts our current government into a dodgy position. One way or another, someone will be displeased, so we must tread lightly."
BAY_focus_on_commies_desc: "Although the nationalists seem poised to overturn the entire system, they lack a strong base that can grant them momentum at a moment's notice. Meanwhile, the red scourge haunts all of Europe, especially so with the fall of the Reich. As such, swift and decisive action must be taken to crush and hopefully neutralize the anarchists who seek to throw us into bloody revolution."
BAY_focus_on_reactionaries_desc: "Even though the socialist threat may seem too big to ignore, they simply lack the politicial infrastructure necessary to take power. Meanwhile, the nationalists have many sympathizers in our ranks and are ready to find the first opportunity they can to overthrow the government. Hence, we must strike down and eliminate these nascent radicals before they throw us back into violent war."
BAY_anti_democratic_legality_desc: "As elections seem to be on the horizon, another major question has arisen. The extremists on both sides have chosen to run in this election, attempting to scare the people into supporting them. As such, we must decide on how to address these radicals."
BAY_the_first_elections_desc: "With the people of South Germany having made their voices heard, now all that remains to be seen is who they have picked to lead them into a new world..."
BAY_centrist_victory_desc: "In a surprising turn of events, the Liberals have made their show of dominance in South Germany as the formerly minor Liberals are propelled into power. Whether this was due to discontent with the mainstream centrists or the strength gained by liberal parties during the election is still up for debate. Nonetheless, all that remains is to see how these former outcasts will now govern South Germany."
BAY_vud_victory_desc: "In spite of the numerous shortcomings faced since their creation, the Independent Democrats have successfully clinched the position as the top party in the [SGF_parliament]."
BAY_clamp_down_on_socialists_desc: "Socialism seeks to degrade and destroy the beautiful democracy that South Germany has and their open agitation against our ways of life can only end in disaster. We must hence immediately work towards neutralizing the socialist threat and moderating those who are still not too radical."
BAY_the_rights_to_vote_desc: "Although we are supposedly a free and democratic state, it seems that much of our country still have the mentality that saying the wrong things could get them in trouble. However, protection of their freedom of expression will help to strengthen our democracy and enable us to live up to liberal ideals."
BAY_support_nonsocialist_unions_desc: "In a democratic society, business and labor interests must be able to cooperate. Despite this, business interests can already support themselves. Hence, non-socialist unions like the Hirsch-Dunckersche Trade Unions should be upheld and given support by our government."
BAY_oppose_militarism_desc: "In spite of the recent war, it still seems that militarists and ultranationalists desire to throw us back into the desolate wastes of the battlefield. To end their agitation, we will go ahead and clamp down on militarism and hopefully put a full stop on the extremist tendencies in the army."
BAY_nllp_victory_desc: "Despite their long irrelvance in South German politics, the National Liberals have maneuvered their way into the [SGF_parliament] and have successfully gained control of South Germany."
BAY_alliance_with_big_business_desc: "Business interests have long helped to dictate liberal policy in Germany. Now with our attainment of power, it is about time we have quid pro quo with our rich benefactors. To this end, tax breaks and political favors will be implemented as well as the road to further cooperation."
BAY_aid_small_businesses_desc: "Although our rivals in the NLLP may boast that they represent the interests of business owners, small businesses are if anything more disadvantaged by their corporate policies than the social democrats! However, this serves as an opportunity for us to swoop in, granting them the support they desperately need."
BAY_our_relationship_with_autdems_desc: "As the party of the landowners and industrialists, we are supposed to represent their interests. Whilst this would have formerly lead to us supporting Wittelsbach's claims, the new situation in South Germany has developed and has forced us to decide what our position on the former Bavarian crown is."
BAY_the_new_norm_desc: "With the question of Wittelsbach settled, we can now finally move South Germany in the direction it is now meant to tread. With this, we can now consider the party stable enough and united enough to become a new major political force in South Germany."
BAY_dealing_with_extremists_desc: "Even as the German people try to move into the future, it just seems some bad actors have to ruin their efforts. Attempting to call for violent revolution against our government is already dangerous enough, thus we must crush these radicals before it's too late."
BAY_the_question_of_treaties_desc: "The treaties that we were forced to obey following our conquest at the hands of our overlord were and are still difficult for us to deal with. Whilst we had been too weak to assert ourselves against our overlord, the political stabilization of the country now gives us the chance to right these wrongs."
BAY_freedom_peace_work_desc: "All throughout Germany, a new era dawns. A new era in which every German can through his own work and effort achieve prosperity, an era in which South Germany stands as a beacon of liberty against the radically new world order we live in. As a new day in Germany dawns, let us be proud of the work that we have inherited from Naumann.\nFor the Reich and the Republic!"
BAY_left_victory_desc: "Perhaps to no one's surprise, the Social Democrats have achieved success in the elections. Long faced with irrelevance and oppression, the rise of the Left has spiked fear among right-wing forces of crypto-socialists taking over South Germany. In spite of this, the people have shown their desire for change and now it only remains to see how South Germany will go forwards."
BAY_right_spd_desc: "With South Germany's conservative nature, it comes as no surprise that a victory of the Left would be a moderate one. As such, the SPD has opted for a more moderate direction, working towards a more democratic and just Germany."
BAY_fight_radicals_desc: "As with all things, there are some people who are discontented with the way things are. These radicals and outcasts then proceed to make things worst for the rest of us. Hence, we must at once stop the radicals before they destabilize Germany too much."
BAY_reconcile_with_church_desc: "Although the church has long been an enemy of socialism, it would be unwise for us to maintain our enmity with them. Considering their power in South Germany, it is time for us to make peace with the church and achieve a compromise for democracy."
BAY_veterans_legislation_desc: "The fall of Germany has impacted many of us, especially the soldiers who now feel they have fought in vain. With our welfare legislation now coming into effect, it would be only just for us to pay back these heroes for what they have done for Germany."
BAY_attack_monopolies_desc: "As socialists, we have a responsibility to defend the workers against the evil capitalists and corrupt bosses. Although this involves certain compromises being made within the democratic system, we must still endeavor to break up corrupt and inefficient entities for the sake of the people."
BAY_left_spd_desc: "With the defeat of Germany, the masses desire change. Even steadfast South Germany could not resist the tide as the left-wing of the SPD have taken control of the country. Although many predict that they'll be forced to temper their rhetoric, it can only be guessed how the revolution proceeds."
BAY_worker_subsidies_desc: "As we take on the mantle as the defenders of the workers, we must give them some relief. Working life is difficult and many workers work tirelessly in poor conditions with minimal pay. Now however, we can finally give them their long-needed relief."
BAY_destroy_the_far_right_desc: "Even as we bring Germany into a new era, there are some that still stand in the way of progress. Worse still, there are some who want to turn back the clock! This cannot be allowed to stand and we must thus act at once."
BAY_enforce_secularism_desc: "Even though South Germany has long been a bastion of religion, there are still many who are unconvinced of this opiate. As such, we need not worry as we now endeavor to do what we should have done far earlier. The church has acted on politics for far too long and it must go!"
BAY_expropriate_parasites_desc: "Even as the people reign in South Germany, it seems that old enemies still lurk. Most especially the House of Wittelsbach, who have at every turn opposed our existence and now ally with reactionaries to restore themselves. Hence, we must bring them down and put them in their place!"
BAY_revolution_by_ballot_desc: "With the approval of the people, we have finally thrown off the old shackles of capitalism and have now progressed towards TRUE socialism. Still, all socialists are in this together and hence we should work together for as long as necessary."
BAY_push_towards_socialism_desc: "Although our arrival at socialism has been done so with the support of the people, the move has definitely shocked our former associates in the [SGF_parliament]. Hence, we must gather support through our fellow socialist comrades to achieve workers' liberation together."
BAY_democratic_socialism_desc: "Through an extraordinary chain of events, we have painlessly escaped capitalist tyranny and are now progressing towards communism. Yet for the average South German, not much has changed. The work cycle continues as normal and new parties emerge over the old.\nNevertheless, we cannot stop here. We must continue working towards socialism. Vorwärts!"
BAY_commit_to_democracy_desc: "How can one achieve the equality of people without democracy? This is a question that sneaky radicals will do anything to avoid, but their refusal to answer only shows their true colors. As such, we must uphold the democratic system and enable it to flourish."
BAY_healthcare_reform_desc: "As we roll out benefits and programs to aid the poorest of our society, we must face the fact that healthcare is something all people need now, more than ever. As a part of our welfare programs, we must thus allow for the people to access healthcare freely without financial worries."
BAY_vorwarts_desc: "As a new dawn slowly rises over Germany, we should take some time to stand and awe at the progress we've made. Much has been done and the German people are happier and freer for it.\nDespite that, there are numerous challenges that lay ahead from domestic troubles to foreign interference. In spite of that, we must endeavor for the people. Vorwärts!"
BAY_right_victory_desc: "As Germany falls into a new era of danger and instability, it has fallen to the right-wing forces in South Germany to take control of the situation. Broadly sympathetic to a restoration of the monarchy and seeking to maintain the old ways, many await with both joy and dismay as to what they will do."
BAY_bvp_victory_desc: "In a totally shocking turn of events, the consolidated Bavarian People's Party have won out. Broadly popular in Bavaria and having many allies in the other South German states, the BVP will still have to deal with the difficult prospects of the nation ahead of them."
BAY_encourage_southern_regionalism_desc: "Even though the fall of Germany was a catastrophe, there has been some boons for South Germany with the collapse of the Reich.\nPrimarily, this benefit is our seperation from the vile Prussians. At every turn, they seeked to exploit the rest of Germany and we cannot doubt their ambitions to turn our homeland into Greater Prussia."
BAY_enlist_farmer_support_desc: "As we move through difficult times, we cannot forget who has made South Germany what it is today. Even as liberals and radicals infest the cities, the farmers who work tirelessly to grant South Germany prosperity get little in return despite their loyalty. We must thus rectify this at once and send support their way."
BAY_swing_against_syndicalists_desc: "Even though the people of Germany move to rebuild and recover, there are just some rabble-rousers who can't seem to let the innocent people be. Syndicalism and its variations attempt to infiltrate and ruin our society by corrupting the people and must hence be stopped at once."
BAY_christian_welfare_desc: "According to Christian teaching, good Christians have the responsibility to aid the poor. Whilst we may not have been able to before, the improving conditions of the state have now given us the ability to help those in need and in doing so, both live up to our principles and beat the social democrats at their own game."
BAY_bp_victory_desc: "In a rather odd turn of events, the King's Party has come out on top. Bolstered by monarchist sentiment and likely to work with the Bavarian People's Party, their focus on Bavaria has nevertheless inflammed criticism of the government in areas outside of Bavaria, making how they will proceed a doubtful affair."
BAY_restoration_of_rupprecht_desc: "At last, we can right the wrong that was inflicted upon Bavaria.\nThat is, the deposition of King Rupperecht. With the republicans out-maneuvered and his Majesty's loyalists now in control, we can now once more proclaim Rupperecht as King of Bavaria."
BAY_the_kings_charity_desc: "Unfortunately for us, the King's restoration has not been received well by all. Most especially, socialists of all stripes and colors denounce our government and spread their nonsense message to the innocent masses by promising them welfare and equality. To combat this, we should demonstrate that Rupperecht is more than capable of providing his subjects."
BAY_push_for_monarchy_desc: "Even though Rupperecht himself is quite popular, the actual popularity of the royal family may still be in doubt. To rectify this, we must fund and advertise papers that help to consolidate the institutions that keep the House of Wittelsbach and the monarchy in favor. In essence, we should drown out the republican cries."
BAY_attack_syndicalism_desc: "There is no idea more disgraceful than the ideology of syndicalism. Treacherous, brutish and cruel, socialism seeks to destory the very fabric of society for some absurd dreams. Unfortunately, such sentiments are still common among unions, of which we must crush and smother entirely into irrelevance."
BAY_reestablish_church_power_desc: "With the restoration of the monarchy in true form, we can now set on bringing Bavaria and the rest of South Germany back to its rightful condition. To get started on this, we must bring in the church and enlist their aid in keeping our rule intact, especially with the recent instability that has plagued our nation."
BAY_sideline_democratic_institutions_desc: "Despite its lofty promises, the recent past has demonstrated the fickle and weak nature of democracy in keeping the state strong. To protect the people and state, we cannot allow bickering and partisan divides to prevent us from decisive action. As such, the King and his ministers ought to be granted enough power to act immediately should they need it."
BAY_in_treu_fest_desc: "For the longest time, the Bavarian Kingdom's motto was 'In Treue fest'. Steadfast and firm, the Bavarian monarchy and the House of Wittelsbach overall have stayed loyal to Bavaria, preventing its slide towards anarchy.\nAll that said, much remains to be done and our new place in the world is still yet undetermined. Even then, we will remain steadfast in loyalty, firm in fidelity."
BAY_the_other_german_states_desc: "Bavaria is not the only state in South Germany. Alongside us, Baden and Württemberg remain alongside us in the currently divided Germany. However, ours being welded together has caused some discontent from the smaller, weaker South German states, especially with Bavarian parties winning out. Hence, we must now figure out how to deal with them."
BAY_embrace_the_church_desc: "The Catholic Church is the one of the few bedrocks of South Germany that has remained unchanged from the war. Uniting everyone from the Rhine to the Danube, the Church helps to keep us together and stop us from falling into chaos. As such, we must strengthen this bulwark and keep South Germany stable."
BAY_justice_freedom_desc: "For the longest time, Germany was a hodgepodge of states forced together by the Prussian boot. Now, we have created a more just and equal federation of states all with the people in mind.\nIn spite of all the work we have put into this however, the question of Germany's place in the world still remains. Are we forever doomed to disunity and division? Nevertheless, we must push on."
BAY_right_wing_desc: "Even as the old Reich falls, the German people still remain. As a new government sweeps through South Germany, it can already be observed that it will not take dissent nor opposition kindly, though its loyalty to the conqueror has already been put into doubt."
BAY_maintain_order_desc: "Although we are supposedly a functional state, the practical truth is that the current state of affairs throughout South Germany is one of chaos and confusion. Whether it is the pestering of nationalists, pleas of monarchists or the silent ignorance of our political allies, we have to contend with much. As a start, we should begin to properly keep order as we determine our next move."
BAY_our_unsavoury_allies_desc: "Whilst we agree on many points, the GVG are undoubtedly savage. Their brutish ways and appeals to the lowest common denominator make them simultaneously a useful yet clunky weapon for the regime to wield. Besides, their desire for power is no secret and may not be well looked-upon by our liberators, making these DVLP-offshoots worrisome."
BAY_our_unreliable_friends_desc: "Even if we are on top, we cannot afford to alienate everybody. Most especially, the monarchists who keep our credibility afloat still demand a promise to restore the monarchy. However, such a commitment is one that is and should not be taken lightly. Nonetheless, they will have to do for now, even if few of our allies have faith in them."
BAY_our_enemies_desc: "As the leftists continue to recede into obscurity, there are still yet many dangerous forces that are kept at bay. Most especially, the heretical and destructive national-syndicalists are as of now not only growing ever stronger, but are also acting against the government. Still, the government's instability prevents us from acting, for now at least... "
BAY_fate_of_nation_desc: "It seems that the unstable coalition of rightists within the government is about to collapse. With opinion of the government at an all-time low and the nationalists growing ever stronger, it comes down to us to determine what comes next..."
BAY_night_of_knives_desc: "With the obstructionist military out of the way, the REAL German state can begin to emerge. Even though many rebuke us as mad Savinkovists or crazy Legionnaires, they are simply fools to believe that we are not a truly German movement. Once and for all, Germany shall be cleansed of traitors!"
BAY_a_revolutionary_tone_desc: "Relatively speaking, Germany is a young nation. As such, a rhetoric of awe-inspiring revolution would resonate well with the public, especially considering how the Second Reich came to its end..."
BAY_convert_conservatives_desc: "Whilst socialism and its equivalents may be appealing to the common man, it is still a downright anti-German ideology. Communards and Bolsheviks of all stripes cannot be tolerated, forcing us to cooperate with the remaining right."
BAY_attack_the_opposition_desc: "With the new state in order, we must now crush any and all remaining dissent whilst we have the chance. Effete democrats and socialist thugs will all be dealt with similarly, finally purifying Germany of her diseased remanants."
BAY_convince_the_military_desc: "As always, the military still remains the biggest obstacle to our takeover. Even though we share similar goals and beliefs, the military needs to be brought under OUR control and thus cannot be allowed to run around freely without some oversight."
BAY_delegitimize_ruppy_desc: "Although there was previously a chance for him to be useful, Rupprecht and his house are now an obstacle to our control over Germany. As such, we must take steps to make sure they do not cause trouble again, preferably being forced from Germany altogether."
BAY_state_of_national_emergency_desc: "Even today, Germany is embroiled in her greatest crisis yet. With Germany split apart, it now falls to us to restore order where we can and make sure the German people are saved from socialism and greedy imperialism."
BAY_benefit_big_business_desc: "There should be no doubt in our minds that big business is a necessary evil. Fickle and selfish, big businesses are perhaps not the most reliable support we can get, but they are certainly very powerful. As such, we will make peace with the corporations and bring them into the new state."
BAY_law_against_undesirables_desc: "With our destiny awaiting us, we must begin to remove the infestations that inhabit our state. Traitorous elements, disloyal groups and undesirable citizens are all to be expelled and if not are to be put under the custody of the state."
BAY_germany_awake_desc: "We have saved Germany from total destruction.\nFor now at least.\nAs a new world dawns upon the German people, we must realize that we cannot sit around and wait for destiny to bring Germany to greatness. The German people are waiting for us, but we are moving as fast as we can. Germany...\nWake Up!"
BAY_crazies_taken_out_desc: "Even when the situation seemed grim, we have finally outlasted the populists and demagogues that seeked to overthrow the government. With the government now finally finding some sense of stability, we can now get to the business of restoring Germany back to her former glory. With all that said, we will have to tread lightly whilst doing so..."
BAY_incorporate_nationalists_desc: "We and the Savinkovites admittedly agree on a not-insignificant number of points. With Germany laying in ruin and subjugated beneath greedy foreign boots, we and the nationalists ought to find common cause to restore Germany back to prominence. Nonetheless, this time they will know that WE are in charge."
BAY_enlist_business_support_desc: "With the situation in Germany beginning to stabilize, we can now look to the groups that help to keep society running. One of these groups are the corporations, the businesses that keep the economy of Germany chugging along despite the war. A deal with them should be made to ensure that we have their support, and that they in turn have ours."
BAY_learn_from_schleicher_desc: "With war always seemingly on the horizon, measures should be taken to prepare Germany for any such possibility. In line with what former general Kurt von Schleicher envisioned, the civilian and military government will now be further incorporated together, to ensure future cooperation."
BAY_military_primacy_desc: "Although we have done much to protect the German people, we see very little in return. No longer! Now all surpluses that are made will be channelled one way or another into the military and its structures. Only then will the German people be safe."
BAY_guarantee_stability_desc: "With our government having gone through numerous bumps along the road to recovery, it should not be surprising that the people have a lack of faith in our government. Luckily for us, a healthy dose of propaganda, promises and threats will lend us some legitimacy."
BAY_handle_the_opposition_desc: "Having stabilized the government, its finally time to put an end to the tiresome leftists who only remain to bully the people and harrass the government. With a final push, the communists and their 'moderate' allies will be pummeled into dust and hopefully permanently swept into irrelevance."
BAY_promise_democratisation_desc: "If the democrats have shown anything, it is that they are spineless, whiny brats who need to seriously shut their mouth. Unfortunately, muscling them will likely invite even greater resentment among the population towards us. As such, we should endeavor to at least appear on the road to democracy."
BAY_gott_ehre_vaterland_desc: "At last, we can bask in the glory of the newly revitalized Germany.\nThat would be true if we were successful in securing Germany, but unfortunately that does not seem to be the case. Nevertheless, Germany's arms stand at the ready behind the army which has always defended her people. With God behind us, the honorable and strong German soldier will save the fatherland."
BAY_glorious_revolution_desc: "Down with the autocratic tyrants!\nThat is the sentiment on the streets of Munich as the former military government has caved in on itself, but the damage it has dealt to democratic and republican forces should not be underestimated. With the socialists on the backfoot and democrats being forcefully laid low, it now is time for the king to finally bring back order."
BAY_begin_reconstruction_desc: "With the dust clearing, what now lays before us is a challenge to rebuild a once-prosperous Germany back from the wreckage it has become. We must act quickly however, both to secure legitimacy and to keep away the radicals..."

 ### News Events ###
 sgf_news.1.t: "Nationalist Takeover in South Germany"
 sgf_news.1.d: "The fall of Germany has left many Germans feeling humiliated and furious as the formerly invincible German Empire is ground into dust. With this, many Germans began to feel that they were “stabbed-in-the-back” so to speak and turned towards ultranationalists who promised revenge.\n\nNow these sentiments have boiled over with the new government proclaiming South Germany to be free of foreign influence and mobilizing as their former overlords prepare for a potential re-occupation of Germany. As the heart of Europe moves towards war, the world watches apprehensively as to what will come next."
 sgf_news.1.a: "Get Munich on the phone NOW!"
 sgf_news.1.b: "What else could we have expected from the former bastion of reaction?"
 sgf_news.1.c: "Under the thunder of liberating vengeance!"
 sgf_news.1.e: "Disturbing"
 sgf_news.1.f: "They may yet be useful..."
 
 sgf_news.2.t: "Revolution in South Germany"
 sgf_news.2.d: "Whilst many had predicted that Germany would suffer major political earthquakes during its defeat and division, few would have predicted that the traditionally conservative South would be the home of the new German revolution.\n\nFeeding on nationalist sentiment and anger against the old government, the socialists have successfully manoeuvred themselves into a position of dominance with their coup de grace being the takeover of the government. With the former occupiers now mobilizing for a potential re-occupation of Germany, the world watches with bated breath as to what comes next."
 sgf_news.2.a: "We cannot let the red menace spread!"
 sgf_news.2.b: "The revolution cannot be stopped!"
 sgf_news.2.c: "Workers of the world, unite!"
 sgf_news.2.e: "How polarizing"
