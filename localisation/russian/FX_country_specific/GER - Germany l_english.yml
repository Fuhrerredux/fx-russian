### History
GER_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The new Reich has arisen. It has been four years since Dressler's Valkists secured power after winning the snap elections. The economy is thriving once again with the Valkists funneling ungodly amounts of money into the arms industry to ensure that in the upcoming wars nobody will stand up to Germany's greatness. \n\nOnly the upcoming years will decide whether Dressler's dreams remain dreams or if the Führerreich will become more than the sum of its parts, with Germany being the superpower it always aspired to be."

GER_splash_title: "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer"
GER_splash_desc: "Since the catastrophic defeat in the Great War, Germany has seen a troublesome and tumultuous time. The old Wilhelmian order was broken beyond repair and replaced with a Republic, enforced by revolutionary forces. When the dust settled, it became clear to many that the fight over the heart of Germany had only just began. The Rhineland was lost to a French aligned separatists and the eastern lands to a new Polish State, to add insult to injury, large reparations were forced upon the young republic and the size of the army was severely limited. As a result, the ongoing economic hardships and humiliation only gave fuel to the flames of unrest and radicalism in Germany. It was during these times, that a new movement arose under the leadership of a war hero and veteran that would change the fate of Germany and the World.\n\nAfter the Great war, many socialist groups were formed in Germany and fought against the republican forces. The latter often had to relay on so called Freikorps. Voluntary units formed from demonilized war veterans with an often far right and reactionary outlook. These Freikorps movements formed their own subculture within the young republic and became the militarized arm of the right wing opposition not only to the socialists but also the republicans themselves.\n\nDressler himself would initially be one of the most vocal intellectual critics of the new republic but later join various Freikorps groups. After a failed coup, Dressler was arrested and used the time to wrote his most important book, Steel and Struggle which would outline the basis of much of his later work. After his time in Prison, Dressler would become a unifying force for many of the Freikorps movements and found a intellectual vanguard for the political right. The Valkist movement was born.\n\nWhile Valkism grew under the skilled leadership of Dressler, so did the political strife and radicalism within the Repulic. Dressler formed the Reichsbund, a alliance between various right wing movements and the Valkists and was named Chancellor shortly after. Together with his majority in the Reichstag, he could rule as the strongman of the republic. What was thought to be only a temporary solution soon became something much larger as Dressler managed to skillfully sideline and undermine his coalition partners, which resulted in the ousting of Papen. When the Reichspräsident died, Dressler led a triumphirate of him, Hughenberg and Jung although it was obvious to everybody who was really in power. With a slew of decrees, the Valkist rule was solidified and Dressler's great work could finally begin."

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_ADAM_DRESSLER_DESC: "An orphan, a Veteran, an Austro-German, Dressler led a very difficult life. Following the Great War, Dressler would find his way to the DNVP and then become one of their most notable and charismatic speakers. Dressler would attempt to assist a DNVP-led coup in 1923, only to be crushed and forcibly detained. During his time in prison, Dressler wrote a fanatic novel titled 'Mein Deutschland das Siegreiche', a novel detailing revenge against the Western Powers and destruction of the Soviets in the East. The novel would become incredibly popular. Following a case that proved Dressler's imprisonment unlawful; he was released from prison and was greeted by hundreds of supporters. Dressler would then build up support for his newly founded Valkistische Volkspartei Deutschlands and then run for office in 1932. Dressler narrowly lost to Otto Wels, declared the results fraudulent, and then lead a coup to bring down the Wels' Government. Dressler declared himself leader of Germany in the Reichstag, something the Entente responded to with hostility due to their belief of the 1932 election being legitimate. Dressler declared a snap-election which led to an overwhelming VVD victory. With it, the Entente reluctantly accepted the belief that the 1932 elections were fraudulent. Since then, Dressler has rearmed Germany from the shadows, prepared to enforce Germany's vision for Europe through Military Might in coming years."

GER_worker_collective_desc: "We should have new reforms to get rid of any anti-worker sentiment within our nation. Businesses with poor working conditions don’t serve the state, nor the people.

ger.10.d: "10/10 was a great speech"
ger.10.a: "Long Live Germany!"
ger.11.t: "Pan-Germanism as our foreign policy"
ger.11.d: "After our shameful defeat to the Entente in the Great War, the German people were unfairly divided between many nations. These states are not true states with any heritage but were unnaturally willed into existence by the victorious powers in an attempt to cripple our homeland. The founding principal of the Valkist party is the eventual reunification of all German people by any means necessary. A truly reborn Germany will stretch from Nanzig to Posan and Kiel to Laibach."
ger.11.a: "One day all Germans will be proud to call 'Deutschland' their home."
ger.100.t: "[GER.GetLeader]'s letter of support"
ger.100.d: "Chancellor of Germany, [GER.GetLeader], has sent a letter praising our great state. [GER.GetLeader] lauds our nation's unique history and the power of leaders like Sun Yat Sen to transform it so quickly into a great power. [GER.GetLeader] ends the letter with 'I have never regarded the Chinese as being inferior to ourselves. You belong to an ancient civilization, and I admit freely that your past history is superior to our own. You have the right to be proud of that past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese remain in pride of their past, the easier it will be for our nations to peacefully coexist'."
ger.100.a: "We shall remember this gift."
ger.101.t: "Germany offers advisors"
ger.101.d: "The powerful nation of Germany has offered to send advisors to our nation to assist our army in modernization. While their advice and efforts will almost certainly be helpful it would be a shame to push local Chinese ministers to the sideline in favor of these foreign bureaucrats."
ger.101.a: "Accept Germany's help."
ger.101.b: "We're better off on our own."
ger.102.t: "Germany offers alliance"
ger.102.d: "Our friend Germany has sent us a formal invitation to join their alliance the 'Stahlpakt'. In these turbulent times, it may be in our best interests to accept this invitation. Ant deterrent against the threat of Communism would be welcomed but at the same time Germany may pressure us into a war we aren't ready to fight."
ger.102.a: "Together we can fight the Communist scourge."
ger.102.b: "We aren't ready for a prolonged conflict."
ger.103.t: "China turns back our advisors"
ger.103.d: "China has refused our offer to send advisors to help reform their government. It seems that, currently at least, we will not be able to influence their nation."
ger.103.a: "We're better off looking towards Europe anyways."
ger.104.t: "China refuses to join our alliance"
ger.104.d: "China has refused to accept our military alliance. We've done much to improve relations with their country so it's very disheartening that they aren't willing to commit more to a continued friendship."
ger.104.a: "China was a waste of time."
ger.105.t: "Valkist march on Vienna!"
ger.105.d: "Thousands of Members of the Valkist Party of Austria are attempting to pressure and overthrow our government. Their forces are strong and determined but we must fight back against this coup at all cost."
ger.105.a: "Protect the parliament building at all cost."
ger.106.t: "Austria asks for help"
ger.106.d: "The Austrian people have asked us to support them against the threat of Germany. The Treaty of Versailles clearly states that a union between these nations is illegal and without the buffer of Austria the entire Balkan peninsula might fall to the Valkist menace. It may be in our best interest to stand up against the threat of Germany now instead of later when they've gathered more strength but many of our own generals warn us that our army may not be ready to fight a major war currently."
ger.106.a: "We must not let Germany pick apart Europe one by one."
ger.106.b: "Why die for Dürnkrut?"
ger.107.t: "France refuses to support us"
ger.107.d: "Our delegation in France has reported that their government has no intentions to stand up for Austria against the German threat. We've wasted too much precious time on the French and now the German ultimatum is nearing its deadline. It seems we will have no choice but to bring up every able-bodied man to arms and fight to defend our homeland."
ger.107.a: "Hurry to arms!"
ger.108.t: "Austria has ignored the ultimatum."
ger.108.d: "Yesterday we gave the pitiful Austrian nation the offer to join the greater German empire. As generous as our offer was it seems that Austrian politicians, blind to the desires of their people, have chosen to ignore it. No nation in Europe has spoken up against our claims to the alpine territory and as such we will not need to worry about any foreign intervention as our armies march into Austria."
ger.108.a: "We will be dining in Vienna by the end of the week"
ger.109.t: "Germany demands referendum in Holstein"
ger.109.d: "In 1919 as the Great War was coming to an end our government decided to intervene against Germany to recover our territories lost in Second Schleswig War. Our elite mobile units were, at the time, some of the best trained and equipped divisions in all of Europe. The few beleaguered brigades the German Empire had left to defend their northern border were no match for our forces and within two days of our declaration of war, we had reached the outskirts of Berlin. The German Empire quickly called for armistice. The strategy used to achieve this quick and overwhelming victory has since been called 'Lynkrig' or 'Lightning War' by historians. Sitting as victors at the Paris Peace Conference, we were awarded back our territories of Schleswig and Holstein but now it seems 'Valkist' Germany is demanding that we give the German people in these regions the right to decide which nation they should belong to through a referendum. Unlike in 1919 our armed forces have been severely ignored so we can't simply disregard this request and risk going to war but it would also be a great insult against our nation to allow Germany to pick us apart. We should ask the Entente to mediate in this conflict."
ger.109.a: "Surely even our German citizens are proud of being Danish."
ger.109.b: "No referendum. We need France's support."
ger.110.t: "Denmark accepts our referendum proposal"
ger.110.d: "Denmark has folded to our demands and now a referendum is in place to settle the 'Holstein question'. The results of this referendum aren't important but now we have a clear indication that the European community will not step in our way as we take back what is ours."
ger.110.a: "Holstein is German once again!"
ger.111.t: "Denmark asks for help"
ger.111.d: "The Danish people have asked us to support them against the threat of Germany. The Treaty of Versailles awarded Holstein to Denmark and therefore should be honored and without the buffer of Denmark all of Scandinavia might fall to the Valkist menace. It may be in our best interest to stand up against the threat of Germany now instead of later when they've gathered more strength but many of our own generals warn us that our army may not be ready to fight a major war currently."
ger.111.a: "We must not let Germany pick apart Europe one by one."
ger.111.b: "Why die for Denmark?"
ger.112.t: "France refuses to support us"
ger.112.d: "Our delegation in France has reported that their government has no intentions to stand up for Denmark against the German threat. We've wasted too much precious time on the French and now the German ultimatum is nearing its deadline. It seems we will have no choice but to bring up every able-bodied man to arms and fight to defend our homeland."
ger.112.a: "Hurry to arms!"
ger.113.t: "Denmark has ignored the ultimatum."
ger.113.d: "Yesterday we demanded that Denmark allow the German people in their nation to choose which country they should live in. As fair as our offer was it seems that Danish politicians, blind to the desires of their people, have chosen to ignore it. It is now in our hands to make this decision for them. No nation in Europe has spoken up against our claims to Holstein and as such we will not need to worry about any foreign intervention as our armies march into Denmark."
ger.113.a: "The Baltic coast will be German soon enough."
ger.114.t: "Bohemia is dying"
ger.114.d: "The government of Bohemia has proven to be entirely ineffective and now their nation is falling apart. Their economy has crashed, they're riots in the streets and their leaders hide in the capital building to save themselves from the chaos. It's clear that it's up to a strong nation like Germany to take back our lands and end this ugly product of Versailles."
ger.114.a: "Bohemia is dead, Long live Germany!"
ger.114.b: "We can't risk war with the French."
ger.115.t: "Bohemia is dead"
ger.115.d: "The government of Bohemia has proven to be entirely ineffective and now their nation is nearly no more. Germany has already taken the first bite. It is time that we retake our northern territory."
ger.115.a: "Bohemia is dead, Long live Austria!"
ger.116.t: "German separatism"
ger.116.d: "Germany is funding separatist groups in Bohemia. Our government has enough problems as it is so this will have hugely destabilizing effects on our nation."
ger.116.a: "Damn Germans!"
ger.117.t: "The fate of Denmark"
ger.117.d: "The Baltic is the life line of Germany, without it our nation would starve. Control of it is paramount if we want to reassert our dominance across Europe. The Entente has shown no interest in protecting Denmark and as such we will have free reign to dictate our will on the tiny nation. Many plans have been sent forward. What should we do?"
ger.117.a: "Incorporate Denmark into the Reich."
ger.117.b: "Take Jutland and give the rest to Sweden."
ger.117.c: "Take Schleswig and create a friendly regime in Denmark."
ger.118.t: "Germany demands referendum in Rhineland"
ger.118.d: "Germany demands that we allow a referendum in Rhineland to determine which nation the Rhenish people will reside in. Rhenish nationalism is almost non existent and the popular Rhenish Valkist party has been pushing for reincorporation into Germany for years now so any referendum will likely not end in our favor but on the other hand all democratic nations deserve the right to self-determination."
ger.118.a: "Allow the referendum to go ahead."
ger.118.b: "We can't let the Germans weaken us like this."
ger.119.t: "France allows referendum in our nation"
ger.119.d: "After caving into pressure from Germany, France has allowed the referendum for a union with Germany to go through. The Valkist party in our country was more than happy to push pro-German propaganda and their efforts have paid off. It seems that a majority of our people would prefer to live in Germany. The Rhineland experiment has ended."
ger.119.a: "Rhineland is dead, Long live Germany!"
ger.120.t: "France refuses referendum in Rhineland"
ger.120.d: "The stubborn French government refuses to listen to the desires of the German people in the Rhineland. We may have to incorporate our Rhenish brothers by force if the French do not yield."
ger.120.a: "We will save the Rhine from French tyranny!"
ger.121.t: "Support the Indian struggle?"
ger.121.d: "We need to use every opportunity we have to weaken the British Empire. There has been much instability in India during the last few years and now an open revolt strikes the sub-continent again. We should support the revolting Indians against their tyrannical overlords!"
ger.121.a: "Prepare the shipments"
ger.121.b: "We have other needs we must focus on"
ger.122.t: "Germany is offering us support"
ger.122.d: "The enemy of our enemy is our friend. Germany has offered to send our fledgling nation advisors. They will help reform our army and transition our industry towards a war economy. As helpful as the Germans might be it might make our movement look weak if we allow the another European state influence our country again."
ger.122.a: "We must accept all the help we can get."
ger.122.b: "The liberation of India must be done by Indians."
ger.123.t: "Germany pushes Valkism towards Norway"
ger.123.d: "In an attempt to bring our nation towards their sphere of influence, Germany has given support to far-right nationalist groups in our country. Despite this we have full confidence that our people will brush away this 'Valkist'nonsense."
ger.123.a: "Norway will not play second fiddle to Germany."
ger.124.t: "Germany offers us an alliance"
ger.124.d: "Germany, the most powerful nation in the Baltic, has given us the offer to join their military alliance the 'Stahlpakt'. With the threat of the Soviets in the east it may be in our best interest to have a powerful ally we can depend on but Germany may also drag us into a war we may not want to fight. What should we do?"

ger.125.b: "We'd rather stay neutral."
ger.126.t: "Germany demands Alsace"
ger.126.d: "Our rival Germany demands our core territory of Alsace. Our soldiers are already arriving at the German border to protect the region. Germany knows we can't accept this offer, it's just casus belli to invade our nation. What we do now will directly determine the course that will define Europe for decades. We need to make a wise decision."
ger.126.a: "The loss of one region surely isn't worth millions of deaths."
ger.126.b: "Ils ne passeront pas! Aux armes!"
ger.127.t: "France refuses our demand"

ger.129.t: "Transylvania summit"
ger.129.d: "When the Entente powers divided Europe in the wake of the Great War, they left the people of the Transylvania in a stateless limbo. The French and British could not agree which nation, Hungary or Romania, they should belong and this issue remains unsolved. We will invite both parties and help make a final decision."
ger.129.a: "Hungary, A long time German ally, deserves Transylvania."
ger.129.b: "Romania, Our enemy in the Great War but a possible ally against the Soviets, deserves Transylvania."

ger.133.t: "Germany demands Lithuania"
ger.133.d: "Our western neighbor Germany has sent our government a demand to relinquish control of Lithuania to their sphere of influence. Most of parliament agrees that our access to the baltic is of grave importance to our sovereignty and we should defend it at all cost but many on the right, some of whom are suspected German sympathies, believe we should organize our nation around a pro-Germany foreign policy. As the threat of Soviet intervention grows everyday we may need German help."
ger.133.a: "Germany really is our friend."
ger.133.b: "Germany has always been an enemy of Poland. We must seek French protection."
ger.134.t: "Poland wants our help."
ger.134.d: "The government of Poland has asked our nation to give them protection against Germany. The Valkist government is using German nationalist sentiments in Lithuania as an excuse to annex this region. It's clear that this is just the first step in a plan to gain complete influence in Eastern Europe. This is a clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles and would be a major security threat to our nation but Poland's only port lies deep within German controlled waters, giving them any serious support would nearly be impossible."

ger.1362.t: "France supports Polish sovereignty"
ger.1362.d: "Despite our noble support for the Lithuanian cause the Entente has decided to abandon all principles and support the Polish enslavement of Lithuania. If we wish to procede we may be draged into another European conflict."
ger.1362.a: "We will secure our Eastern frontier."
ger.137.t: "Holstein Crisis - Fate of Danish arctic territories"
ger.137.d: "The Holstein Crisis between Germany and Denmark has failed to find a peaceful solution and now these nations find themselves at war. It's clear that Germany will soon be the victor in this conflict and as such may leave them in control of the Arctic territories of Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. These islands could be used as a base to station ships and bombers in range to easily strike the British Isles. We can not allow this to happen. Ships and marines are already preparing to take these regions and now we just need your word."
ger.137.a: "The operation can go through."
ger.138.t: "German army marches on Brno"
ger.138.d: "Ever since the Sudetan Crisis the German government has had a large influence on our politics and now their army marches on our capital. Bohemia is to become the newest province of the German Reich. The end of Bohemia is near."
ger.138.a: "Bohemia is dead"
ger.139.t: "Germany demands German Bohemia"
ger.139.d: "German nationalists in the north of our nation have caught the attention of Germany. The Valkist regime now demands we surrender these regions to them. Our nation is in no place to fight the Germans. If we are to have any hope of keeping these regions we must petition France to protect our sovereignty."
ger.139.a: "We can't risk a war. Give Germany what they want."
ger.139.b: "Surely the French will stand with us."
ger.140.t: "Bohemia wants our help."
ger.140.d: "The government of Bohemia has asked our nation to give them protection against Germany. The Valkist government is using German nationalist sentiments in German-Czechia as an excuse to annex these regions. it's clear that this is just the first step in a plan to fully dismantle the weak Bohemian nation but we may not be able to give the land locked nation any real support in the case of war."
ger.140.a: "France will stand up for her friends."
ger.140.b: "Why die for Děčín?"
ger.141.t: "France has abandoned us"
ger.141.d: "Our delegation in France has reported that their government has no intentions to stand up for Bohemia against the German threat. We've wasted too much precious time on the French and now the German ultimatum is nearing it's deadline. It seems we will have no choice but to bring up every able bodied man to arms and fight to defend our homeland."
ger.141.a: "Hurry to arms!"
ger.142.t: "Bohemia has ignored the ultimatum."
ger.142.d: "Yesterday we demanded that the pitiful Bohemia nation allow their German people to return to their true home. As fair as our offer was it seems that Bohemia politicians, blind to the desires of their people, have chosen to ignore it. No nation in Europe has spoken up against our claims to the territory and as such we will not need to worry about any foreign intervention as our armies march into Bohemia."
ger.142.a: "I shall return to my home Tetschen a hero!"
ger.144.t: "Bohemia is dead."
ger.144.d: "It has been clear to many that the nation of Bohemia was not long for the 20th century. Germany has cut the head of the nation and now we have a chance to take what is ours back."
ger.144.a: "Let our brothers return home."
ger.147.t: "[GER.GetLeader] declares the Treaty of Versailles dead"
ger.147.d: "As part of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the Great War, Germany was dismantled and humiliated following immense territorial concessions to the Entente. When our party came to power in 1933 we were forced by threat of French intervention to abide and respect the terms and limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles, but now that France is in the middle of a devastating recession we are confident that their government will be too weak to stand up to us. We can now build our strength and defy the Entente without hesitation."
ger.147.a: "We will no longer bow to Glass Giants."
ger.148.t: "Appointing a new economic minister"
ger.148.d: "To overcome the influence that the Entente powers have over Europe we must shift the economic center of Europe from France to Germany. Two plans have been drafted to have Germany's industrial output out pace France's a soon as possible. One by our lead architect Adolf Hitler who want to tie the economies of lesser European nations to Germany, giving us an advantage over them and an opposing plan by Otto Stressor in which the state will take over key industries to maximize efficiency. Which one should we institute?"
ger.148.a: "Hitler's the man, He's never been wrong."
ger.148.b: "Strasser is the better choice."
ger.149.t: "The TST question"
ger.149.d: "The Kampfregimenter was too autonomous and disorganised to be a reliable defense force for Germany. The Thuleschutztruppes were created by [GER.GetLeader] to be his own loyal force, immune to the influence of ambitious officers. There recent expansion though has left many questions about there role in the German armed forces unanswered. Two proposals have been sugested for the TST. The first is that the TST should lead our army in offensive operations using there thorough traing and skills to achive decisive results. The other proposal is to have the TST manage the internal security of our nation and occupied territories, eliminating opposition and keeping our troops in order as needed."
ger.149.a: "The TST should be part of frontline operations."
ger.149.b: "The TST should be in the reserves to keep order."
ger.150.t: "Standard German university curriculum"
ger.150.d: "To keep our hold on power we must make sure that our universities keep in line with Valkist ideals. How should we direct our higher places of learning?"
ger.150.a: "They should focus on improving Germany."
ger.150.b: "They should focus on spreading German influence."
ger.155.d: "Today German panzers made a spearhead into the French capital of Paris. No 'miracle' of the Marne could have stopped the brutality and speed of the German offense this time. Now German soldiers march down the streets of Paris celebrating there victory. [GER.GetLeader] has even announced his intention to tour the city and plant the Valkist flag on the Eiffel Tower himself."
ger.156.d: "Like Odoacer before them German forces have once again sacked Rome. The Italian defense was desperate but the superior German troops were able to overcome and take the city. In the chaos of the situation many Italians have even seeked refuge into the Vatican city but demand for shelter has outstripped the small nation's ability to provide."
ger.157.d: "German troops have crossed the alps and have overrun the Po Valley, taking the key port of Venice in the process. For the first time since the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, Germans now have access to the Mediterranean."
ger.158.d: "Despite the natural barrier provided by the Rhine River, The combined French and Rhenish force was unable to hold there ground against advancing German Panzers. This surely spells the end of the Rhenish puppet state."
ger.159.d: "After a quick campaign into Poland, German troops have surrounded the Polish capital of Warsaw. After a night of heavy shelling German troops were able to take the city with only minor opposition. Now that our Eastern territories are secured we can focus on France or push onto the Soviet Union."
ger.160.d: "After a quick operation through Rhineland we have been able to pierce through the defenses of Alsace and our forces are now on there way towards Paris. The days of the French Republic are numbered."
ger.161.d: "For the first time since the conquests of Napoleon, The alpine state of Switzerland has fallen to foreign arms. Now that we are control of this strategic region we can expand our operations into France and Italy."
ger.162.d: "Just like the Imperial army 20 years before us we have successfully flanked the French army through Belgium. The pitiful resistance of the Belgium armed forces was no match for our own troops. With Belgium out of our way we now have access to the undefended interior of France."
ger.163.d: "For the first time since the Norman conquest of 1066, The city of London has fallen to a foreign force. Tower Bridge suffered much shelling damage from British defenders when German Panzers made there crossing but once across the British defense collapsed rapidly. Now that the heart of the Empire is in our control it is only a matter of time before it collapses."
ger.164.d: "The Ukrainian army, after years of strangulation from Moscow, was completely incapable of stopping the German advance through there territory. Now our forces surround the last desperate defenders of Kiev. As soon as the city falls we will have control of vast farmlands o feed our people."
ger.165.d: "Our campaign up the Baltic has ended at the gates of Leningrad, birthplace of the Russian Revolution. Following our decisive siege the city fell and the Russian defenders were forced out. Now the USSR is cut off from the Baltic and isolated from the world."
ger.166.d: "After a hard fought campaign through the Soviet Union we have taken the heart of the collectivist empire, Moscow. This is clearly the beginning of the end of the degenerate Marxist state."
ger.167.d: "With Hamburg finally in our Hand its time to make it the New Naval Hub for Germany. Hundreds of ships shall be built in the Dockyards of its City. The question remains what the priority should be on."
ger.168.d: "[GER.GetLeader] has died. His rule has defined Germany for nearly the last decade. In the aftermath of the Great War, Germany was crippled by the victorious Entente powers and the history of Europe changed forever. The old Germany had died in the conflict and out of it's ashes a new vision for the German people arose. [GER.GetLeader]'s political philosophy and reforms lead Germany to reemerge as the predominant power of Europe. As The 2nd Great War expanded across the continent, the German army was able to easily overwhelm the Entente and avenge the injustices made at Versailles. \n\n1942 opens with our nation dominating the world stage. The German people finally belong to a nation to be proud of but not all is good within Berlin. At a meeting with the 'Großer Rat', [GER.GetLeader] collapsed into a stroke. He was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital where he failed to regain consciousnesses and died a few hours later. An X-ray scan showed a small piece of shrapnel, an injury caused by a French artillery attack during the 1st Great War, had finally pierced an artery in his brain leading to a fatal hemorrhage. News of his death was kept secret for many days as not to ruin the moral of the German people during these challenging times but for our government to continue we must choose who should succeed [GER.GetLeader] and his legacy. \n\nThis will no be an easy decision as many factions fight for control due to the massive power vacuum created by [GER.GetLeader]'s untimely death. For many within the inner circle of the Valkist party it seems that Anton Arco-Valley, the right hand man of [GER.GetLeader], should be the next Führer. The TST, The ever growing German paramilitary group lead by the eccentric Rudolf von Sebottendorf, has gained significant influence on the policies of Germany due to their role in the war effort. Some fear that he may initiate a putsch and install himself as Führer. With the death of the [GER.GetLeader] much of the unity within the party has been lost. Infighting and debate on the future of Germany has broken out. Hermann Goring has started a faction who believe that the war has met all it's goals and wish to see the conflict come to a close. Goring and many others want to focus on building Großdeutschland into the sole world power [GER.GetLeader] had originally envisioned. The fate of Germany and the world may rest upon what transpires these next few days."
ger.169.d: "The Summer games have begun. Athletes from all over the world have met in Berlin to compete for glory. German chancellor, [GER.GetLeader] has spared no expense showcasing the beauty and power of his nation. Adolf Hitler, the favorite architect of [GER.GetLeader], has designed lavish public works within and around Berlin including the magnificent Reichssportfeld stadium. The competitions this year might be the most exciting yet as nations from all over the globe battle for the most medals"
ger.170.d: "After 2 weeks of stiff competition the 1936 summer games have concluded. While many nations took home medals the United States and Germany won the most. At the closing ceremony [GER.GetLeader] used the victory of the German athletes to proclaim the superiority of the 'New German' a man free from the constraints of traditional Christian morals and who could lead his life as he saw fit. Despite the cheers from the crowd those from the nations which surround Germany have taken this to be a foreboding statement"
ger.172.d: "Since it's construction in the 14th century Notre Dame has stood as one of Europe's most awe inspiring religious halls. A group of young Valkists have petitioned our government to allow them to practice there ritual within the church. The Nordic inspired group wishes to practice traditional German religion and hope to use this to help spread their movement. While this could help spread Germanic influence among the Valkist's living in Paris we may want to be cautious about upsetting the more conservative members of Parisian society and government."
ger.175.d: "Beginning it's circumnavigation of the globe the Zeppelin Tanngrisnir takes off at an airfield outside of Berlin. The path of the airship will have it land in the most prestigious nations on Earth. It's first stop will be England where it is rumored that Edward VIII will be in attendance to see Tanngrisnir land. Following this the ship will stop in France, cross the Atlantic to New York, refuel in San Diego, Cross the pacific towards Japan, breifly stop in India and finally make it's last showing outside of Instanbul. A ship it's size and power will diplay the clear supremacy of Valkism to the international community."
ger.190.d: "Disputes between Otto Strasser and [GER.GetLeader] have been growing for years now. Stasser's anti-capitalist views have gathered the negative attention of many Valkists officials and have even earned him accusations of holding Socialist sympathies. [GER.GetLeader]'s recent appointment of his personal architect Adolf Hitler to the post of Economic Ministers effectively pushed Strasser our of German politics. As a result of this Strasser has fled to Danish controlled Holstein to support its fledgling Collectivist movement. This turn of events is has been a national embarrassment for the Valkist party and only serves to give ammo for [GER.GetLeader]'s detractors."
ger.192.d: "After the Great War France and the other Entente powers establish themselves as the overseers and protectors of Europe. To accomplish this goal France established the Entente Council as an organization to mediate any conflicts that arise on the continent. Every year delegates from all across Europe gather in Paris for 2 weeks of discussion and debate. This year is shaping up to be the most important Council yet. The economic depression caused by the London Stock Market Collapse is forcing nations to scramble for solutions and the threat of German rearmament looms over us more and more. The continued stability of Europe may rest on the outcome of this council."
ger.193.d: "Now that delegates have rived from all across Europe we can begin discussions. Many issues will need to be discussed by the end of this council. We must establish how to deal with Germany's complete disregard of the Versailles Treaty, an action that must not go unchecked. We must also touch upon the recent economic depression that is sweeping through Europe. For a quick recovery we must agree on a unified strategy. The final issue that has been suggested for discussion is the diplomatic status of the Soviet Union. in 1917 our ally, the Russian Empire, fell into a brutal civil war in which the liberal democratic White forces were pitted against the Collectivist Red forces. By 1922 most of the White force was defeated and many of there leaders immigrated to Paris. In an act of solidarity the Entente has refused to recognize the USSR as the legitimate Russian state but without British support and the rising threat of Germany it may be time to set aside our ideological pride and focus on pragmatic needs. To send a strong message to the German Reich we must be on good terms with the powerful Soviet Union."
ger.194.d: "When [GER.GetLeader] took power in Germany he promised his supporters that he would restore the Reich's former glory. It is clear now that he is willing to do this at any cost. When the London Stock Market Crash swept through France and Europe, [GER.GetLeader] took the opportunity to announce that Germany would no longer abide to the Treaty of Versailles. As our delegates speak the German war machine that lead to the deaths of over 20 million people during the Great War roars back to life. \n\n It has been agreed early on that France and the greater European community are in no shape to disarm Germany by force but if we take action now we may be able to cripple [GER.GetLeader]'s goal of rearmament. Germany is incredible dependent on it's neighbors for it's industrial sector. If we can agree on proper weapon sanctions we could bring Germany's arms industry to a halt but many delegates worry that hurting there own arms industry in the middle of a recession isn't worth the small diplomatic foot hold over Germany."
ger.195.d: "After hours of arguing a final vote on the German issue has been reached. Proponents believe that sanctioning the German arms industry will cripple Germany's ability to wage an offensive war but opponents believe that this would only damage there nation's own arms industry which relies on German income to survive."
ger.196.d: "After hours of debates the Entente Council voted against sanctioning Germany. Fears that this action would hurt there own arms industry ran rampant through the delegates chamber. France will now have to find her own ways of dealing with Germany."
ger.197.d: "After hours of debate the Entente Council has voted to sanction Germany. Most delegates were swayed by the hope that sanctioning the German arms industry would destroy there plans for rearmament. Only time will tell if this proves true."
ger.198.d: "The cowardly French have pressured a horde of nations to sanction our country in attempt to damage our arms industry. The Entente and their allies will no longer sell arms and weapon manufacturing equipment to our nation. Despite French hopes though this will only be a small road block in the way towards our goal of a German dominated Europe."
ger.199.d: "The London Stock Market Crash has caused what may be the greatest economic recces ion to ever effect Europe. Unemployment sores as companies and businesses are no longer able to keep there doors open. France has drafted an economic recovery plan to asst Europe through this disaster. In it our nation would be obligated to increase taxes on high earners and use the profits to subsidies currently operational business. In addition to this we would also need to keep exporting resources to Entente Council members that require them in an attempt to keep there industry operating. The hope is that these policies will prevent any further bankruptcies and stop the rapid unemployment. Many delegates worry that these policies are too rigid and don't take into account the specific needs that each individual nation may have."
ger.200.d: "After hours of arguments a final vote on how to approach the economic recovery has been made. Proponents argue that economic cooperation and austerity policies will be needed to overcome the recession while opponents argue that the French economic recovery plan is is too rigid and fails to address the specific needs of individual nations."
ger.201.d: "The Entente Council could not come into agreement over an economic recovery strategy. The French plan failed to resonate with the other delegates."
ger.202.d: "Despite initial opposition to the French plan, the council delegates have agreed to support it and institute it's policy's within there own nations. In times of real struggle international cooperation is vital."
ger.203.t: "[From.GetName] suggest we recognize the Soviet Union as the legitimate Russian government"
ger.203.d: "The Great War was a conflict so devastating it brought down the most powerful and vast continuous empire to ever exist, Russia. After 3 brutal years of war the Russian state fell into a civil war where the liberal White forces fought the collectivist Red forces. Eventually the Reds were victorious and many White leaders were forced to flee Russia. Many of these men ended up in Paris. In an act of solidarity with there former Russian ally the French and the Entente agreed not to recognize the USSR as the legitimate Russian state. While this once served the interests of the Entente the rising threat of Germany may force us to reconsider this policy. Being on good terms with the Soviets may help deter German aggression."
ger.204.d: "After hours of arguing the delegates have gathered to make a decision on the status of the USSR. Pro-recognition delegates argue that the USSR is too powerful of a nation to ignore and ideological obsession with the defeated Whites does none of our nations good while Anti-recognition delegates argue that granting the Soviets any legitimacy will give inspiration to collectivist back home who will take our action as a sign of support."
ger.205.d: "Despite the growing threat of the German Reich the Entente Council has chosen to continue there policy against the Soviet Union. The Entente will continue not recognizing the USSR as the legitimate Russian state."
ger.206.d: "In a surprising turn of events the Entente Council has announced that it will recognize the Soviet Union as the legitimate Russian state. Former White officers living in Paris have denounced this action calling the Council 'A rotten den full of back stabbers'."
ger.207.d: "France has announced the Entente Council will now recognize us as the true successor to the former Russian Empire. The French have even offered us the former Russian embassy in Paris for Soviet use. This warming of relations between our nations gives our Revolution and struggle legitimacy upon the world stage."
ger.208.d: "After days of discussions and important decisions the French have concluded this years Entente Council. Hopefully the decisions and policies adopted by this Council will pave the way for a better and stronger year in 1937."
ger.209.d: "After a nights rest delegates from Europe's most prestigious nations once again convene at the Entente Council to discuss the most important matters effecting Europe."
ger.210.t: "Germany declares the Versailles Treaty dead"
ger.210.d: "Today Germany has announced the beginning of an arms build up in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, the treaty that brought the Great War to an end. German Chancellor, [GER.GetLeader] has even voiced the opinion that the Treaty's stipulation are 'A cruel attack against Germany and her people' and that 'Deutschland will never again be subservient to any power'. This is clearly Germany's attempt to gain influence in Europe in our moment of weakness and we can not stand for it! Some army officials such as Maurice Gamelin believe that France will need to reform her Military in order to show the Germans we're willing to meet any force with force."
ger.210.a: "We must stop German aggression at any cost"
ger.210.b: "Greenlight the Military Reforms."
ger.211.t: "Stahlpakt conference for the on going war effort"
ger.211.d: "Through brutal conquest we have been able to avenge the shameful defeat we suffered in the Great War nearly 20 years ago. We are the undisputed masters of Europe and no nation can stand in our way. Despite our clear dominance the stubborn French still attempt to thwart our rule from north Africa, expanding this conflict from a European conflict to a full World War. A conflict of this scale will require close cooperation between all members of Stahlpakt. We shall invite representatives from the Franzosischer Freistaat and the Italienisch Freistaat to Berlin to discuss plans and strategies to help bring this war to a final end."
ger.211.a: "Send the invitations"
ger.212.t: "Germany invites us to discuss the war effort"
ger.212.d: "German arms have unified Europe behind a single goal for the first time since the age of the Romans. Despite this the former French Republic still continues to resist from Algiers. To help bring this war to an end the German Reich has invited us to a conference in Berlin to discuss a unified strategy to quickly bring this war to and end."
ger.212.a: "We have much to discuss"
ger.213.t: "Delegates arrive in Berlin"
ger.213.d: "Delegates from the Franzosischer Freistaat and the Italienisch Freistaat have arrived in Berlin to begin discussions on the war. Both nations have proposals they wish to put into action. We must thoroughly think through what ever plan we choose to support."
ger.213.a: "What is the first plan?"
ger.214.t: "Beginning of the Berlin Conference"
ger.214.d: "Our delegates have arrived in Berlin to discuss the ongoing war effort. Our generals have drafted many laws for us to consider. We must be think thoroughly on which one we decide to propose to the council."

ger.219.d: "German Chancellor has decided that the Berlin Conference has met all of it's goals for now.

ger.220.t: "Germany offers us support divisions"

ger.224.b: "We can't risk the safty of our nation"
ger.225.t: "Slovakia joins Stahlpakt"
ger.225.d: "Predictably the weak Slovakian nation has accepted our offer for protection. While there military provides little benefit for us, there position in central Europe will help spread our imfluence in the region."

ger.226.t: "Slovakia refuses to join Stahlpakt"
ger.226.d: "The pathetic Slovakian nation has refused our offer for protection. Though this can hardly be considered a loss for us this action will doom there nation to become a foot note within future history books when stronger nations take the oppurtunity to conquer the weak nation."

ger.230.d: "Our take over of the Czech state has left us in control over their once formidable tank industry. Specifically 244 Czech light tanks have are now ours for the taking. It is clear that these weapons should be absorbed for use within our armed forces. A modern army needs modern tanks."
ger.230.a: "The Panzer 35(t) will make our nation proud"
ger.233.t: "Germany requests an increase in food imports"
ger.233.d: "German economic minister Adolf Hitler has come to our nation in the hope of signing a trade deal for the increase of wheat exports to Germany. Germany's agricultural sector is straining under the weight of a rapidly growing population and as land is falling to urban sprawl less is available for farming. Ukraine is well known as the bread basket of Europe. Our agricultural sector is the largest part of our economy. Signing a deal with Germany will help it grow substantially over the next few years but some ministers fear that Germany may have great ambitions in Eastern Europe and we should avoid any threats to our security by working with them."
ger.233.a: "This deal will do us good"
ger.233.b: "We shouldn't work with Germany"
ger.234.t: "Ukraine agrees to export more food"

ger.235.d: "Despite hours of negotiations Ukraine has refused to export more food to our nation. Eastern Europe is too volatile of a region to bother with anyways. We must look for other sources of grain to help support our ever growing population."
ger.235.a: "Ukraine is destined to be Soviet target practice"
ger.236.t: "Germany wants to invest in our Oil Fields"
ger.236.d: "As Germany expands it's armed forces their demand for petroleum increases along with it. Oil is scarce in Europe but as Germany becomes more diplomatically isolated on the world stage their demand for more local sources becomes louder. Ukraine is home of some of the largest oil reserves in Europe but the lack of infrastructure greatly reduces our ability to export this resource though. Germany's economic minister Adolf Hitler though has drafted a plan to remedy this. Germany will fund the expansion of our oil refineries and in return we must agree to export a required amount to Germany.

Now though Germany has extended an olive branch and wishes to help support our endeavor in bringing peace to Kiel but only if in return we cede our German majority regions over to them.

ger.277.t: "Serbia refuses our demands"
ger.277.d: "Despite our threats Serbia has chosen to stay neutral in current European conflict. Without that 2nd front on the Greek-Serbian border we are nearly helpless to support our Turkish ally. An invasion of Serbia is in order if we wish to see Turkey survive."
ger.277.a: "Prepare the Panzers"
ger.278.t: "The Turkish Front"
ger.278.d: "Despite our best efforts to support our Turkish ally it seems that the Turks are having setbacks in dealing with the combined Greco-Entente forces that surround their nation. We fear that they will soon collapse if we don't assist them soon. Serbia is the only nation in between us and Greece. Demanding that Serbia opens a 2nd front on the Greek border would help alleviate pressure off Turkey and cement ourselves in the eastern Mediterranean."

ger.281.d: "Despite their desperate situation The [From.GetName] refuses our alliance."
ger.283.t: "Soviet forces retreat"
ger.283.d: "All was calm this morning on the Eastern Theater. The pounding of Soviet artillery that just yesterday filled the empty vastness of the steppe has finally gone silent. The Russians now retreat from the front more organized than usual burning all habitable land in their path. It is clear that the Russians intend for us pay in German blood for every last inch of Soviet Russia. It'll take some months to repair the damage caused by the desperate defenders and even more to organize a new offensive into the Urals. Many of our own officers even suggest that the war in the east has met it's obvious conclusion as we occupy the most valuable land the Soviets would ever own. Dragging this conflict on for any longer may not be worth the human cost."
ger.283.a: "We don't need to expand past the Urals"
ger.283.b: "The Soviet Union can't be allowed to exist"
ger.281.a: "We will need to fortify our borders quickly then"
ger.284.t: "Strategic retreat to the Urals"
ger.284.d: "As German forces continue to gain momentum and push our army back it is clear that our ability to continue the war is rapidly declining. Many generals are beginning to organize a retreat to east of the Urals where we can organize a more permanent defense from German forces. It's strongly believed by our intelligence that Germany will not push past the Urals giving us even more time to rearm without interference."
ger.284.a: "Begin the retreat and scorch everything in your path"
ger.284.b: "Ni shagu nazad!"
ger.285.t: "The Fate of Russia"
ger.285.d: "Our country occupies vast swaths of formerly Soviet territory in Eastern Europe. It's is clear to most commanders that we can't continue a military government over such a large territory forever. Creating a civilian administration for Russia under our own supervision would help alleviate administrative maintenance of this region. (If you experience a crash soon after picking the first option pause the game, pick the option and save. Reloading that save should avoid a crash)"
ger.285.a: "Form R.K. Russland"
ger.285.b: "Germany will stretch to the Urals"
ger.286.t: "Our army is forced back!"
ger.286.d: "Our enemies are pushing us deep within our territory! We must fully mobilize! We have severely underestimated our Enemies, we must stop them here or fall! Everything we can muster will be used against our enemies, we've scrambled together a defensive plan to respond to this breakthrough and have pressed Great-War arms into service!"
ger.286.a: "Ni shagu nazad!"
ger.288.t: "The Fate of Iceland"
ger.288.d: "The British occupation of Iceland and several other formerly Danish arctic territories has left us in control of a region that has for decades been granted home rule. It does us no good now to arbitrarily revoke this status from the Icelandic people and as such it has been proposed that we establish the Dominion of Iceland. This would grant us good will among the Icelandic people and help but a better spin on our occupation."
ger.288.a: "Form the Dominion of Iceland"
ger.288.b: "Iceland is of too much strategic importance to allow civilian rule"
ger.289.t: "The Fate of Theoderichshafen"
ger.289.d: "Theoderichshafen, known as Sevastopol to the local population, has been inhabited by a small German community since the end of the Roman Empire. Within the navy plans have been drafted to annex this major port city and develop it into Germany's own Gibraltar of the east. Not only would this be a major source of propaganda for our nation it would establish our military influence right next door to the Soviet Union."
ger.289.a: "Annex the port"
ger.289.b: "Lets not upset our new Ukrainian ally"

ger.263.d: "The Entente and British armies have become organized very differently since the end of the Great War. Our once powerful unified army that destroyed the Kaiser's forces 20 years ago no longer exists. It'll take time and thorough arguments between our two general staffs to help mend this divide"
ger.1000.d: "Our government has been an international pariah ever since the end of The Great War. The Treaty of Versailles carved our nation apart and left it a shadow of it’s former glory. In 1933 [GER.GetLeader] lead a Coup which put his ‘Valkist’ party in power. Though it was massively popular with the people of Germany, the Entente powers with the support of Britain put sanctions on our nations and spread propaganda to our citizens criticizing [GER.GetLeader] as an anti-Christian warmonger. In this troubled time many factions have arose in Germany to undermine the Valkist Party using the international controversy too their advantage.\n\n Popular war hero, Hermann Goring has been the leader of the second largest nationalist faction in Germany for many years. Though Goring sees eye to eye with [GER.GetLeader] on many issues he disagrees with [GER.GetLeader] radical philosophy and also strongly believes that to have a fighting chance to win another Great War, Germany must be fully self sufficient. Goring has laid out a 4 year plan that will make Germany competitive with the other Great Powers in the case that another conflict were to break out but until that point Germany must appear peaceful as to not grab the attention of the ever watchful French, our greatest threat on the continent.\n\n When [GER.GetLeader] took power he disbanded the Reichstag. [GER.GetLeader] is a vocal opponent to liberal democracy and saw the Reichstag as only a roadblock in the way of restoring the greatness of Germany. With suspected funds from France though many pro-democracy factions have pushed for the reestablishment of the Reichstag. Despite the inherit slowness of democratic systems plans have been drawn up in which [GER.GetLeader] would remain Chancellor for life with final legal say but a new Reichstag would be formed to draft laws and administer smaller local issues. Giving power to a separate legal body may danger the influence of [GER.GetLeader] though but the facade of democracy may satisfy the French and the liberals within our borders.\n\nWithin the inner circle of the Valkist party a final solution has been drafted to have any opposition to [GER.GetLeader] eliminated. A great purge will rid Germany of anyone who seeks to undermine Valkist authority and will cement [GER.GetLeader] as the unquestionable Fuhrer of all Germans."
ger.1001.d: "The United States of America has found itself at war with the British Empire. These two nations were our adversaries in the Great War but now we can use there conflict to our advantage. The imperial British pose way more of a threat to our nation than the isolationist Americans. The enemy of my enemy is my friend so it may be to our advantage to send supplies and men to support their war effort and hopefully defeat the British menace once and for all."
ger.1002.d: "Germany has offered to send supplies to support our war effort against the British. In the Great War our nation found itself at war with the German Empire but now it seems that our former enemy may be our newest ally. Many within congress are against receiving German equipment though. Taking a hand out from a warmongering nation the likes of Germany does not paint this conflict in positive light but on the other hand we must do whatever it takes to win this war."
ger.1003.d: "The United States have graciously accepted our support. How the tides have turned. One time the Arsenal of Democracy, The USA is now forced to takes arms from it's former rival. This speaks volumes to the power and prestige of the reborn Germany."
ger.1004.d: "The United States have ignorantly refused our support. The undeserving prideful Americans say they have no need for foreign support. They overestimate their ability just like at the Battle of Château-Thierry and just like then many American soldiers will needlessly die."
ger.1005.d: "In a surprising move the German government has come to Britain to renegotiate the restrictions on their navy. They claim that the legal tonnage of ships as dictated under Versialles is too low for a modern nation the size of Germany. They seek to increase the maximum size of the navy while also agreeing that it shall not compete with the Royal Navy. On top of that they wish to sign a non-aggression treaty as a promise of peace between our nations. While this all sounds nice many in Parliament do not wish to go behind France's back like this while others say that this poses too much of a risk to our Navy and the British Isles"
ger.1006.d: "The United Kingdom has agreed to our revision of the Treaty of Versailles. We now have legal authority to increase our maximum tonnage of ships and a guarantee that war shall not break between our nations."
ger.1007.d: "The United Kingdom refuses to negotiate any of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. Those weak willed British still play 2nd fiddle to the French. It's clear we will not receive any support from the West and as such we must treat both France and Britain as our enemies. Despite this set back we must still grow our naval power, Versailles be damned."
ger.1008.d: "The German Reich demands that we let troops move through our borders. Our nation blocks direct access between Germany and Italy, 2 states that see themselves at war now. If we allow them access it will surely bring our nation into their sphere and bring the conflict here but we are also in no position to fight off a German offensive, even if we receive French support."
ger.1009.d: "Austria refuses to comply with our demands. While this was not unexpected it will still slow down our advance into Italy."
ger.1010.d: "Austria allows are troops access through their territory. With this freedom we can bring Austria into our sphere and quickly smash the Italian Army."
ger.1011.d: "The German Reich has requested our support for the 'Bohemia question'. After the Great War the nation of Bohemia was formed as a union of western Slavs but this federation was forced upon its members against their wills. Currently millions of Poles are forced to live under a foreign and vile government. Germany has promised to reward us these Polish territories if we support their planned occupation of the Czech state. It is clear that the French will not intervene, too weak and cowardly to stand up to any real threats in Europe but we must also be wary of working with Germany. [GER.GetLeader] is not one to follow the traditional rules of diplomacy and such we should never take his promises particularly seriously, though this may be our only opportunity to reclaim Lemko."
ger.1012.d: "The German Reich has requested our support for the 'Bohemia question'. After the Great War the nation of Bohemia was formed as a union of western Slavs but this federation was forced upon its members against their wills. Currently the tyrants in Brno occupy thousands of square miles of former Hungarian territory. Germany has promised to reward us these territories if we support their planned occupation of the Czech state. It is clear that the French will not intervene, too weak and cowardly to stand up to any real threats in Europe but we must also be wary of working with Germany. [GER.GetLeader] is not one to follow the traditional rules of diplomacy and such we should never take his promises particularly seriously, though this may be our only opportunity to reclaim Slovakia."
ger.1013.d: "The Polish state has accepted our proposal. When our armies cross into Bohemia we will be able to count on Polish forces to support our invasion and divert the Czech forces. If we're lucky they'll bleed themselves dry and spare our men the trouble."
ger.1014.d: "The Hungarian state has accepted our proposal. When our armies cross into Bohemia we will be able to count on Hungarian forces to support our invasion and divert the Czech forces. If we're lucky they'll bleed themselves dry and spare our men the trouble."
ger.1015.d: "The foolish Poles have refused to support our cause. Our generous offer was apparently not enough for the bureaucrats in Warsaw. Despite this change in plans we will continue with our goal to dismantle Bohemia."
ger.1016.d: "The foolish Hungarians have refused to support our cause. Our generous offer was apparently not enough for the bureaucrats in Budapest. Despite this change in plans we will continue with our goal to dismantle Bohemia."
ger.1017.d: "German forces have marched into Bohemia and are currently engaging with the Czech army. As part of our agreement with Germany we are now obligated to begin our own military operation into Bohemia. Our forces are trained and prepared to retake our territory, All we need is your word."
ger.10171.d: "After a series of German victories it has become clear to the Zapodoslavian High Command that any further opposition would be hopeless. The Czech army has been continuously routed and little territory remains for them to defend. In the chaos of the situation the Bohemian government has been forced hastily flee to France, leaving many great men behind.\n\nOnce again the German army has shown it's overwhelming power. [GER.GetLeader]’s dream of a united Großdeutschland marches one step closer but now we must make the final decision on how to divide the former territories of Bohemia."
ger.10172.d: "The Hungarians proved themselves to be dependable allies when they invaded Slovakia as part of our struggle against Bohemia. They now demand full control over the territory we promised them. Though it may be in our interests to maintain positive relations with the Hungarians, officers within the military believe that maintaining a military occupation of Slovakia and eventually installing a loyal regime would serve our expansionist aims better. Hungary is an unproven nation but a seemingly a loyal one."
ger.10173.d: "Despite our support against Bohemia, Germany has chosen to occupy the previously promised territory of Slovakia. After a short series of battles German forces pushed our army back behind the pre-war border. This whole campaign has been a national embarrassment leaving our once proud nation a weakened pariah within the greater European community."
ger.10174.d: "The Poles have proved themselves to be dependable allies when they invaded Lemko as part of our struggle against Bohemia. They now demand full control over the territory we promised them. Though it may be in our interests to maintain positive relations with the Poles, officers within the military believe that maintaining a military occupation of Lemko and eventually installing a loyal regime would serve our expansionist aims better. Poland is a targeted nation with enemies on all side but a possible ally against the Soviet menace."
ger.10175.d: "Despite our support against Bohemia, Germany has chosen to occupy the previously promised territory of Lemko. After a short series of battles German forces pushed our army back behind the pre-war border. This whole campaign has been a national embarrassment leaving our once proud nation a weakened pariah within the greater European community."
ger.1018.d: "As tensions rise in Europe once again it is paramount to find strong allies. The German Reich has offered to send us advisors to overlook the development of our industry and army. We are surrounded by the extreme ideology of Socialism, Norway to the west and the Soviets to the east. If we wish to survive against the tide of revolution we must take all the support we can get. Many of the more moderate officials within the Swedish government warn that [GER.GetLeader]'s Valkism is just another face of socialism and that we should seek the support of the more established and reasonable democracies of western Europe."
ger.1019.d: "Our diplomatic venture to Sweden has ended in success. They have accepted our ministers and as such our relationship steadily grows."
ger.1020.d: "The Swedes have turned back our ministers, claiming that they have no desire to receive support from a regime like ours. We approached them with open arms and support for their sovereignty but it seems they would rather risk becoming another SSR within Moscow's sphere."
ger.1021.d: "Our war with Norway has attracted the attention of many anti-Socialists within Europe. Hundreds of German nationalists have crossed the Baltic to volunteer for our cause. They are incredible dedicated to defeating Norwegian Socialism and seemingly loyal to Sweden. We must get them in the field as soon as possible"
ger.1022.d: "After weeks of planning Otto Skorzeny is prepared to infiltrate the Norwegian capital of Oslo. He and his team will travel by U-boat, avoiding shipping lanes and land on the outskirts of the city in the early morning under the cover of darkness. From there he will enter the city and plant explosive charges on several industrial targets. If this plan is a success it will severely weaken the Norwegian capability to wage war against Sweden."
ger.1023.d: "Diligent planning and excellent initiative has resulted in Skorzeny successfully completing his raid on Oslo. Though his team infiltrated the city without issue they soon raised the suspicion of local authorities. Skorzeny's poor skill in the Norwegian language and obvious Austrian accent did not help matters but nevertheless he and his team decided to proceed. Taking a safer but slower route to their objective, the team was able to avoid any further detection and planted explosives on some of the designated factories before sunrise forced them to retreat prematurely. Though not to the scale originally planned, this operation was still a success."
ger.1024.d: "Poor planning and lack of talented leadership has resulted in Skorzeny being apprehended by Norwegian Authorities. Troubles plagued the operation from the beginning. The U-Boat used to transport the men landed well within sight of the Norwegian Coast Guard forcing the men to scatter into the local forest instead of the designated rendezvous point. A couple hours were then spent regrouping, losing precious time for the operation. When the group was finally able to attempt infiltrating Oslo local authorities, who were already on alert from previous spottings, interrogated the strange, out of place men walking their streets. When questioned by police, Otto Skorzeny's atrocious attempt at Norwegian cleared any doubt of his team's true nationality. Our government has denied any connection to Skorzeny's actions but few are convinced. Otto Skorzeny's failure has been a huge embarrassment for our nation."
ger.1025.d: "In the night hours of the early morning a factory producing arms for the war effort against Sweden suffered from a catastrophic explosion that has left 29 workers either dead or injured. Originally thought to be caused improperly produced artillery shells, further investigation points to intentional sabotage from and foreign source. More investigation will be needed before a solid culprit can be identified but in the mean time this has been a major set back for our war effort."
ger.1026.d: "Earlier this morning a German U-Boat was spotted near the waters of Oslo. The ship dived before our navy could investigate but supplies left on a near by beach suggested that a contingent of soldiers may have been left behind. With this knowledge we put the police on Oslo on heightened alert. A couple hours later a confused group of men were spotted walking the streets. When approached by the police they acted nervous and attempted to inform us that they were in a hurry to get back home, or so we think. Their thick German accents made it hard to understand. The group was then taken into police custody for further questioning. It's clear that these men are German agents but both them and the German government remain silent ad to there purpose. A trial is soon to be set for the men, where a court will certainly find them guilty of crimes against our state."
ger.1028.d: "Germany has recently approached our nation with a proposal to sell us arms at a massively reduced price. Reforms to the German army has made this equipment obsolete for them but we may be able to find uses for these weapons. The Anti-Polish faction within our government supports increase cooperation with Germany but most within the more conservative factions see Germany as a threat to our sovereignty. We have a need to modernize our army but we must be wary of German influence or appearing treasonous to the Poles."
ger.1029.d: "Our generous offer to the Lithuanians has be rejected by their foreign minister. We may have to rethink our plans of playing the Lithuanians off the Poles. The blind government in Kaunas would rather remain Polish slaves than have a taste of freedom."
ger.1030.d: "Lithuania has accepted our erogenous offer for an arms sale. Right now hundreds of shipments of German equipment cross the border into Lithuania. This will hopefully help the Baltic state fight off Polish authority and" solidify our relationship for future German-Lithuanian cooperation."
ger.1031.d: "Germany's intelligence agency has revealed to us documents claiming to show a Polish military build up on our border. If these documents are true it is clear that Warsaw is planning a swift takeover of our homeland. If we choose to heed Germany's advice we must act quickly and disarm all Polish brigades within in our territory and prepare our army to defend against any intrusions though our border. Despite the possible risks many within our own intelligence circle doubt the validity of the German papers. There information is vague and supporting evidence is lacking. While Germany may not be the most trust worthy nation we should not let personal squabbles distract from the real threat."
ger.10311.d: "Despite our evidence to the contrary, Lithuania refuses to believe that Poland has any intention to reduce their autonomy. They have expelled our intelligence ministers and have made it clear that they seek no further cooperation with our nation."
ger.1032.d: "Germany has sent our government an ultimatum. In it they demand the return of our western territories that our home to large German populations. After the Great War most Germans left these regions when our government took over but this still has not dissuaded The German Fuhrer, [GER.GetLeader], who claims that these territories are part of 'Großdeutschland' or 'Greater Germany'. On top of there demand for territory, they also stipulate that we install pro-German ministers into several important government positions and that Germany will have complete control over our foreign policy. \n\nThis is a clear assault on our sovereignty. We must get the French to support us in this cause and help us fight back if the situation leads to that. Our military staff on the other hand warns that any armed conflict with Germany will almost certainly end in defeat and even if the French agree to support us, German dominance over the Baltic will keep any supplies or men from reaching us. \n\nThe deadline approaches ever closer. We must make a decision."
ger.1033.d: "In a unsuspected turn of events the Poles have agreed to our ultimatum. Currently Polish forces are withdrawing from their former western positions and our army is moving in to assume control. The dream of a united Germany now marches closer to our grasp and with most of eastern Europe in our sphere of influence can begin preparations for our crusade against the Collectivist Russian state."
ger.1034.d: "Our ultimatum has passed and the Poles still refuse to relinquish South Prussia and Posnan. It is clear that this crisis can only be solved with bullets and men. Our armies are stationed on the Polish border and are posed to strike. Give your word and our armies will crush Poland."
ger.1035.d: "Germany has offered to send military officers and equipment to help us modernize our army against the Soviet threat. In a recent speech German Fuhrer, [GER.GetLeader], has stated that 'Poland is the front line protecting the civilizations of Europe from the vile philosophy. of Collectivism. There brave victories against the Soviet Union should be an inspiration for all citizens. of Germany.' Kind words for sure but the German people have never been trust worthy friends of Poland so we should be incredibly wary of any German support."
ger.1036.d: "Poland has accepted our offer. With the growing threat of the Soviet Union the Polish military staff has accepted the need for more international cooperation and military expansion. Hopefully this is the just the beginning of cooperation against Russia."
ger.1037.d: "Poland has rejected any support from us. The Polish foreign office even claims that 'Valkism is just another face of Collectivism'. Attempting to work with Poland was nothing short of foolish. We will now have to find different allies to stand up to the threat of Russia."
ger.1038.d: "German diplomats have come to our government to request a formal alliance between our nations. This would give a strong protection against the Soviet Union and give us easier access to German ports on the Baltic, decreasing export and import costs. While these positives stand out the wording of the German document is vague enough to require that our nation support German wars in western Europe. This scenario would be disastrous for our nation but protection against Collectivism may make this deal too important to refuse."
ger.1039.d: "Poland refuses to formalize any alliance with our nation. They'd rather keep good relations with the cowardly French even if they risk the future of their country."
ger.1040.d: "The German Reich has offered us a protective alliance against the Soviet Union. During the Russian Civil War we captured the Russian territory of Besarabia which has been claimed by the Ukrainian SSR ever since. For protection of our sovereignty we may have to accept a German alliance. Both France and Britain are too far to provide serious protection,"
ger.1041.d: "Romanian officials reject our proposed alliance. Despite the increasing threat of the Soviet Union the Romanians prefer to stay on good terms with the backstabbing French. While it is obvious to us that the French are too far away to provide them assistance, this information has seemingly alluded the Romanian government. We will have to look for other allies in our crusade against Collectivism."
ger.1042.d: "Germany has offered to sell us military equipment and manufacturing tools at a reduced price. This will help supply up our armed forces but the flood of German equipment may deinsentivise Polish owned companies from investing in further research and development. Your cabinet warns that this may help our armed forces in the short term but long term dependence on Germany may weaken our nation permanently."
ger.1043.d: "Poland has accepted our trade proposal. Despite objections from some within the military staff, This deal will bring funds into Germany and hopefully force the Polish state to become dependent on us for support. A true win win situation."
ger.1044.d: "Poland has refused our generous trade proposal. Despite the backwards state of their army the Polish military still insist that they are better on their own without outside interference. If Poland chooses to paint itself a target for the Soviets there is not much we can do."
ger.1046.d: "Our ports are the lifeline for both Lithuania and Poland but under Russian rule they fell into disuse. Today they still remain underdeveloped which has hurt our economic development. Germany has approached us with a deal to develop these ports. This would help increase our access to the Atlantic but our economic advisors warn us that under these provision the ports would be majority owned by German investors who would certainly put the foreign policy goals of Germany over the needs of Lithuanians. Global trade is the mark of great nations but Germany's ambitions may cause our home more harm than it's worth."
ger.1047.d: "Lithuania has agreed to allow Germany to develop there Baltic ports. Our agreement will give German shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd a majority stake in these new dockyards, giving Germany major influence over Lithuania. Slowly the Baltic will rightfully be in Germany's sphere of influence."
ger.1048.d: "Lithuania has refused our offer to assist them in developing their naval facilities. Despite historical lack of support the Lithuanian government will continue to petition Warsaw to for funding leaving stunting their economy in the mean time"
ger.1051.t: "Our coup was successful!"
ger.1051.d: "Our well planned coup which was executed by Ernst Kaltenbrunner yesterday is successful as the putschists were able to get control of Vienna and the surrounding areas. Having successfully arrested the whole cabinet, Kaltenbrunner declared himself Leader of the new Austrian Nation. Nobody really resisted him as Dollfuß’ reputation had been in free fall lately."
ger.1051.a: "Excellent, prepare the Anschluss."
ger.1051.b: "Excellent, lets keep Austria as a satellite."
ger.1052.t: "Our coup in Austria was defeated!"
ger.1052.d: "The well planned coup led by Ernst Kaltenbrunner was smashed today as the Putschists were caught in a firefight with Austrian Policemen and Members of the Army. After securing most of Vienna the Putschists were trying to march onto the Austrian Parliament, where the Austrian Government under Dollfuß was currently holding a conference, were caught in a firefight with Members of the Austrian Police and loyal soldiers of the Austrian Army, which with reinforcements coming in from St. Pölten was able to repel the Putschists and disperse them. Dollfuß has officially denounced Germany for trying to undermine the Austrian Government. He called the coup the Final Insult by Germany."
ger.1052.a: "We will not tolerate this!"
ger.1052.b: "Maybe we should bide our time…"
ger.1060.d: "The German government, at the advice of economic minister Adolf Hitler, Has passed drastic reforms on their work visa policy. Germany will no longer issue these visas to Rhenish citizens. and all currently existing visas are now void. This has cause huge upset in our economy that will take some time to recovery and adapt from"
ger.1061.d: "German economic minister, Adolf Hitler, has sent our nation a comprehensive trade deal pertaining to our iron reserves. In it Germany will purchase our Austrian iron at higher than market value if we promise to give preference to the iron demands of German companies over Austrian ones. While this income would be of great benefit to our federal budget the possible damage it may do to our own industry may not be worth it."
ger.1062.d: "The Austrian government has agreed to our trade proposal. We can now rest easy knowing we have a reliable source of iron flowing into our nation. Hopefully this cooperation with Austria will lead the Alpine nation into becoming, firstly, dependent on Germany and secondly a defacto part of Großdeutschland."
ger.1063.d: "The Austrian government. refuses to participate in our trade proposal. We must look towards obtaining other sources of iron or adopt a more persuasive posturing against Austria."
ger.1065.d: "The German Reich has begun a massive project in the Austrian Alps to dam the Danube river. The Danube is life line of almost every nation in the Balkans. It's waters foster the food production of millions of people. Any disturbance to it's flow will have massive effects on the communities and industry that rely on it."
ger.1066.d: "After years of German blood, sweat and tears the Danube river has been dammed. As German engineers ready to get the dam into operation we must all marvel in this feat of human engineering. This project will provide power for millions of Germans and help spur the growth of our economy for years."
ger.1067.d: "One of Germany's first victims, Austria, has become a staging area for the impressive Danube dam. This project has become the heart of German industry. Officers within the Armée de l'Air believe that we can quickly achieve a crippling blow against Germany be destroying the dam through a decisive bombing strike. The pilots will leave early morning and use the cover of darkness to avoid detection while they fly over Austrian territory. The operation will be costly and with all night missions, very difficult but if we can achieve this objective we will gain an advantage over Germany we severely need."
ger.1068.d: "In the early morning hours unidentified planes were spotted flying over western Austria. They were quickly identified as French air craft and their objective was determined to be our glorious Danube Dam. We have scrambled our nearest plains to intercept but the French have caught our air force off guard and unprepared. The fate of nearly all industry in Austria rest in the hands of our brave German pilots."
ger.1069.d: "The French strike on our territory was unfortunately successful. Despite the bravery of our pilots they were unable to overcome there French adversaries. The Danube dam lies in ruins. It will take millions of Reichsmarks and months of work in the best of conditions to make it operational again. With our war with the French in full swing we cannot currently divert any material for this repair task. For the immediate future the pinnacle of German engineering will remain in ruins."
ger.1070.d: "Despite being caught off guard we have overcome the French attack. There few remaining pilots fly desperately back to France, too afraid to fight like real men. The courageous German pilots that made this victory possible will be welcomed home as heros of the Reich. Men like these show once again the dominance that both Valkism and Germany have over Europe."
ger.1071.d: "Despite our thorough planing and training our pilots were unable to complete their objectives in Austria. We underestimated the size of the German force in the area which quickly lead to the French strike team becoming overwhelmed. After taking severe losses to German air craft the French survivors were force to retreat. We cannot risk a loss this devastating again."
ger.1072.d: "Our thorough planning and training gave our pilots the edge needed to complete their objectives in Austria. Thanks to the swiftness and surprise of our attacks the Germans had no chance to scramble many plans to intercept our own. After a short dog fight the French pilots cleared the way to their objective and successfully bombed the Danube dam. The heart of German industry lies in ruins and slowly the Valkist war machine will grind to a halt."
ger.1073.d: "German economic minister, Adolf Hitler, has sent our nation a comprehensive trade deal pertaining to our tungsten reserves. In it Germany will purchase our Swedish tungsten at higher than market value if we promise to give preference to the tungsten demands of German companies over Swedish ones. While this income would be of great benefit to our federal budget the possible damage it may do to our own industry may not be worth it."
ger.1074.d: "The Swedish government has agreed to our trade proposal. We can now rest easy knowing we have a reliable source of tungsten flowing into our nation. Hopefully this cooperation with Sweden will blossom into a full fledged alliance."
ger.1075.d: "The Swedish government. refuses to participate in our trade proposal. We must look towards obtaining other sources of tungsten or adopt a more persuasive posturing against Sweden."
ger.1076.d: "German economic minister, Adolf Hitler, has announced an increased fee on all foreign ships entering the Kiel canal. This is clearly Germany trying to pressure and control our connection to the rest of world. Shipping companies are already demanding that we provide them some sort of assistance in the face of this drastic change."
ger.1077.d: "Adolf Hitler, economic minister for the German Reich, has announced a new law that would lower the import costs for goods coming from 'Neighboring German communities'. The territories of German Bohemia are specifically mentioned in the announcement where Hitler hopes that all Germans can benefit from the economic success of the German Reich. Despite the his cheerful disposition it is clear that Hitler's real goal is economic hegemony over our German regions. Under this law many German owned companies within Bohemia would greatly benefit from "
ger.1078.d: "Winters in Germany can be brutal for those unable to prepare. Every year from late October to early March the annual Winterhilfswerk drive commences where millions of Germans gather provisions for the less fortunate. millions of tons of food, water and clothing will be distributed to poor mothers and children all across Greater Germany. Together we will help all Germans get through the frigid winter."
ger.1080.d: "After years of design and construction the first Hindenburg class airship, 'Tanngrisnir' has been completed and is ready for flight. Named after the one of the goats who pulled Odin's chariot in Norse mythology, the Tanngrisnir is Germany's most advanced and impressive airship built to date. The vessel is prepared to commence long distance passenger flights within the following months but other uses have been suggested. \n\nBeing capable of intercontinental flights the ship would be capable of a circumnavigation in which we could share the glory a Valkism across the globe. On the other hand our military staff still see the possible military application of high altitude Zeppelins. When stationed at such heights Zeppelins are nearly undetectable from the ground. With this advantage we can easily spy undetected over enemy nations and scout out there air fields and garrisons giving us an advantage over the opposing force. Whatever we choose to use Tanngrisnir for, the vessel will remain an impressive achievement in aviation."
ger.1081.d: "Soon after the German declaration of war against our nation, The German air force bombed many of our military air fields and army garrisons before we could even have the chance to react. Many of these sites should have been hidden to Germany. Even the German army seems to have advanced knowledge of our troop's positions and movements. We can't seem to ever catch them off guard. We must organize our units under the cover of darkness to avoid any further leaks but until our army will be compromised."
ger.1083.d: "[GER.GetLeader]'s infatuation with pre-Christian German culture has pesuaded him to fund a sceintific expedition to Sweden to research this lost society. Germany's best scientists and historians will go on this mission to help find a better understanding of the origins of the German."
ger.10832.d: "A few months ago a Swedish farmer, Albert Johansson, had discovered the corpse of a man in a bog by his home in Bocksten. Local authorities had discovered that the corpse was at least several centuries old by the time our own experts arrived to assist in their research. Further examination of the 'Bocksten' man has shown that he was a most likely Christian priest who lived sometime around the 13th century, the tail end of the Christianisation of Scandinavia. Despite his holy position it seems that he had been murdered by the local people of medieval Sweden. In what we can only assume to be a final desperate attempt to save their pure Germanic culture from the corrupt claws of Christianity the Norse Swedes of the region beat the priest to death and finished him off with a stake through his heart. This ferocity and passion of these ancient Germanic people must be looked upon as an example to follow for all future Germans who wish to protect their culture and nation from foreign corruption."
ger.1082.d: "Germany is home to the greatest minds of the modern era. Our state has given these men and women the resources necessary to fulfill there endeavors. With rearmament though we must be cautious where we spend our Reichsmarks though. \n\n2 great minds have petitioned our government for monetary support for there projects. Kondrad Zuse, an engineer and mathematician, has pitched the idea of a calculating engine that would be capable of processing complicated math faster and more accurately then any human. Zuse has postulated many practical uses for this device such as calculating ballistic physics to improve the accuracy of our artillery or even the ability to mathematically encode our messages so they cant be decypherd by the enemy.\n\nThe other man of interest to consider is Kurt Diebner a physicist. The recent discovery of nuclear fission has inspired him to to consider the possible weponification of this phenomenon. When a nucleus is bombarded by neutrons it can split the nucleus, releasing a massive amount of energy. Better understanding and implementation of nuclear fission could lead us to create a new class of explosive completely incomparable to current designs. While promising even Diebner admits it will take years of work to even confirm if a weapon of this design is even feasible.\n\nBoth proposals show promise but with the military absorbing more and more of our national budget we must choose who to fund wisely."
ger.1084.d: "In a surprisingly hostile turn in foreign policy the German Reich has banned our ships from entering the Kiel Canal. Clearly this move is targeted to lessen our influence in the Atlantic. We must look for other trade routes now."
ger.1087.d: "Turkey at the behest of there ally Germany have announced that Soviet ships will no longer be allowed to pass through the Bosphorus straight. This will completely block our nation from the Mediterranean. Germany is trying it's best to starve our nation to death. We must find new trade routes to counter this."
ger.1088.d: "Using outdated Austrian claims to the land the German Reich has demanded that we return Tyrol to them. Millions of Italians fought and died for this territory. Giving into Germany will not only be a disgrace to there legacy, without Tyrol the entire Po valley will lack any natural defense against further German aggression. While our generals are ready to fight to the death for this land, the sons of those fallen Great War heros are not."
ger.1089.d: "Italy has refused our demands, completely disregarding the will of the Germans who make up the majority in Tyrol. Italy is truly the successor of Rome, a dying and degenerate state one sword blow away from collapse. History shall repeat itself as the sons of Odoacer slay the bastards of Romulus."
ger.1090.d: "The cowardly Italians have surrendered Tyrol. These people will bow to any threat no matter how hollow. The Entente alliance once again shows itself to be too weak to stand up to any aggression. Germany will soon be the undisputed master of Europe."
ger.1091.d: "The government in Paris has refused to support the independence of Austria. It is clear that the French are more than happy to allow Germany to walk all over them. Now that Austria is destined to be occupied by Germany it is only a matter of time before there ambitions turn towards us. Austria was a natural buffer between our states and if that dissapears we will be easy prey for Germany. Many generals support protecting Austria against German aggression. With Italian support the mountainous nation may be able to defend there territory. Our foreign minister is ready to invite Austrian officials to a meeting in the small lake town of Stresa to discuss these matters. Protecting Austria may be our nation's last hope."
ger.1092.d: "The Italian foreign minister has invited our nation to a meeting in the small lake town of Stresa. There they wish to discuss forming a defensive alliance with our nation to protect our sovereignty against Germany. With no other ally on the continent we must accept there proposal"
ger.1093.d: "Germany, taking authority over Austrian affairs, has demanded that we return the territory of Burgenland to them. This territory has been part of Hungary for hundreds of years but despite this Germany baselessly claim that the German speaking population of the area wish to return to German rule. Despite our poor relations with France we should still bring this crisis to there attention and request support but the chances of a positive response from France are low. To avoid bloodshed it may be in our best interest to give into Germany's demands."
ger.1094.d: "The Hungarians have heard our arguments and have agreed to cede the German majority region of Bergenland back to us. This victory has bolstered support of our rule over Austria. The goal of a united Großdeutschland marches closer."
ger.1095.t: "Hungary asks for our support"
ger.1095.d: "The Hungarians have disclosed to our nation an ultimatum from Germany in which they demand control over the core Hungarian territory of Bergenland. This territory has been part of Hungary for centuries and the local population is, at best, ambivalent to German rule. While politicians can support action against Germany many officers in our military warn that our armed forces may not be prepared to fight off a German offensive let alone support a far off land locked nation."
ger.1095.a: "We must fight German aggression"
ger.1095.b: "Why die for Debrecen?""
ger.1096.d: "The French foreign minister has informed our nations that France is in no position to mediate a conflict between Germany. This leaves our nation few options. As the German ultimatum hits it's deadline we must prepare our forces to defend our land at any cost."
ger.1097.d: "The deadline for our ultimatum against Hungary has passed. Hungary still refuses to relinquish Bergenland. Our army has prepared for this and will take this territory by force as soon as you give you're word."
ger.1098.d: "The Hungarian army and government has collapsed. Decisive action by our armed forces have left us in control of the entire Carpathian nation and now we must decide on a plan to end our military occupation. A simple transfer of power to a loyal Hungarian regime may be the simplest plan but our foreign minister has also suggested that we divide Hungary amongst the neighboring nations of the Balkans to improve our standing with them."
ger.1099.d: "Territorial disputes with Hungary have complicated relations between our nations for years. Germany has generously offered us this territory, settling these disputes for good."
ger.1100.d: "The German government has invited our nation to a military exercise. During the Great War our forces fought each other for nearly 5 years, both sides never able to gain the advantage over the other. It took until 1919 for our forces to overcome the German onslaught. It is clear that we both can learn much from each other but the scars of the Great War are still felt in our military staff, many of whom are wary of Germany."
ger.1101.d: "Britain has agreed to participate in a military exercise with us. Both sides will hopefully gain much needed experience in modern warfare from this. It also seems that the British may be interested in further cooperation with our nation."
ger.1102.d: "Britain has refused to participate in a military exercise with us. There delusional generals apparently think they have nothing to learn from us. There splendid isolation will not protect them forever."
ger.1103.d: "Officers and men from both nations have arrived in Germany for the Anglo-German military exercise. Both sides will be put under pressure as there soldiers, vehicles and officers are tested in mock combat exercises. The Great War gave hint to the power of combined arms but it'll have to be shown if those lessons stuck."
ger.1104.d: "Germany has offered us a trade deal in which they will trade to us heavy vehicle equipment at below market value if we in return sell them our naval equipment. While this deal would help develop our land forces our naval officers are wary of giving any support to a possible rival's naval"
ger.1105.d: "The British government has agreed to sell us valuable naval equipment in return for our heavy vehicle equipment. This deal no only brings our two nations together but will greatly help our own nation develop a powerful navy."
ger.1106.d: "The british government has refused to sell us any naval equipment. We will have to look for other sources of these valuable supplies if we wish to further develop our navy."
ger.1107.d: "Germany has offered us an alliance against the French. Our relations with France have been soured for many years now and it may be time to settle our issues and the battlefield. With German support we will easily make the French submit to our will. Despite this argument many minsters are still wary of Germany who's warmongering ways, they warn, will not end with France. Not since the age of Napoleon has London been allied with Berlin, are we sure we want to change this?"
ger.1108.d: "Britain has agreed to join Stahlpakt. Our goals and ambitions are aligned. The age of a France dominated Europe must come to an end and just like with Napoleon a century ago the charge will be lead by British and Prussian arms."
ger.1109.d: "Despite our mutual hatred of the French, Britain has refused to sign a formal alliance with us. While the French will be no problem for our armed forces, occupying France may bring our two nations into conflict. We must avoid this for the time being."
ger.1110.d: "Germany has occupied Lithuania and together with Lithuanian troops, they prepare to annex Latvia. Within this chaos we have been given an opportunity. With no international support we can easily occupy northern Latvia without worry. This will bring our nation one step closer to liberating the Baltic states."
ger.1332.t: "Poland surrenders Lithuania"
ger.1332.d: "Poland has agreed to our ultimatum and now Lithuania has become part of our Sphere of Influence. The Lithuanian revolt put enough pressure on Warsaw to see the validity in our demands to abandon both Lithuania and Latvia. The nationalist faction in Kaunus now has control of the country and with there assistance we will help bring Valkist philosophy to their populace and the Baltics as a whole."
ger.300.t: "Vienna calls for Peace!"
ger.300.d: "While our victorious troops are marching deeper into Austria by the hour, the Austrian government in Vienna has issued its unconditional surrender. We now control all of Austria and now are one step close to the glory that is a United Germanic Empire!"

ger.1150.d: "With the fall of our former overlords in Paris, many in our government are now calling for peace with Germany. Whilst we were once bonded to France and made to fight alongside them, now we must consider whether or not it is truly worth it to continue the fight."

ger.1054.t: "The Valkists have been defeated."
ger.1054.d: "The unorganized Valkist mob has been defeated. Austrian police were able to easily deal with their attempted coup and now Valkists leaders are being rounded up for trials. Though little is concrete we have enough information to determine that Germany was clearly behind this attempted insurrection. Europe is no longer safe. We must take a side if we are to survive this century. The Entente will surely side with us against the German menace."
ger.1054.a: "The fate of our nation will be decided in Paris."
ger.10511.t: "Germany allows us to keep self government."
ger.10511.d: "In the wake of the Valkist coup it was expected that Germany would incorporate Austria directly into the greater Reich but a decree from the German chancellor, [GER.GetLeader], has allowed Austria to stay in control of it's own domestic affairs while all foreign policy will be dictated by Berlin. Germany will also have the right to appoint and remove any government official the see fit. While this has appeased some Austrian politicians, many are still vocal opponents of Germany."
ger.10511.a: "Germany really is our friend."
ger.400.t: "The Future of our Republic"
ger.400.d: "Fighting rages on across our Republic, and in the past days we have begun to see a total collapse of our front lines as German forces punch through our defenses at lightning speed and with brutal efficiancy. Many have declared these to be the final days of the Third Republic, and hope is fleeting. \n\nCharles De Gaulle, recently promoted to Brigadier General for his gallant actions during the early phases of the German invasion, has approached the faltering government with a most radical plan. For the past week he has been desperately drawing up plans for a complete evacuation of our military and political assets across the Mediterranean Sea to our holdings in Algeria so that we may continue the fight there. Little needs to be said of the ambition of this plan, and simply the idea of it has caused great divide in our already weakened government. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been given the unfortunate task of deciding whether or not to accept De Gaulle's plans, and no matter which he chooses many more Frenchmen will die and support for his party will be lost. \n\nGeneral De Gaulle has repeatedly stressed that this is the only way for us to defeat the German menace which ravages our land, and with the sound of battle drawing nearer, we are evidently out of time to ponder the outcome of either decision."
ger.400.a: "We must continue the fight, no matter how far we must flee..."
ger.400.b: "Nonsense, we have them on the back foot!"
ger.401.t: "The African Flight"
ger.401.d: "France is ours! The government of France has collapsed. Their weak army was no match for ours and now they flee to Algiers. Only a few disorganized French divisions remain in Europe for us to clean up. As soon as we establish a friendly regime in Paris we will begin preparations for an invasion of North Africa. The French navy is still quite strong so we must plan thoroughly to overcome this. While the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe fully support an invasion of Algiers many generals in the Wehrmacht believe that we should focus our military on easier targets in Europe. Our strength on land is proven, our Navy is not. For now though we have established ourselves as the greatest power in all of Europe. We must choose our direction carefully to keep this position."
ger.401.a: "We can crush these impudent Algerians later"
ger.401.b: "We won't let a sea stop us!"
ger.402.t: "Industrial equipment smuggled out of France."
ger.402.d: "Those who choose to flee France had to abandon many of their possessions. Very little heavy equipment was able to be brought to Algiers before the Valkist took over the mainland but a secret network of French partisans have been able to dismantle a large amount of industrial equipment from factories in southern France and are now ready to ship it Algiers for reassemble. This will greatly increase the output of local industry and will significantly improve our ability to wage a war against Germany."
ger.402.a: "The French spirit can not be broken!"
ger.403.t: "The fate of France"
ger.403.d: "Our victory over the French Republic has left us in control of nearly all of western Europe. 40 million non-Germans now live under our occupation and are certainly not accepting of it. Two plans have been drafted on how to deal with the unrest. We can establish a puppet regime in Paris lead by Valkist and head of the French Popular Party, Jacques Doriot. This nominal autonomy might calm down some of the unrest or at a minimum make it their issue instead of ours but many officers also believe that we should let our military directly keep a watch over the citizens of France and use any force necessary to keep them in line. While the second option would be expensive it could be more effective."
ger.403.b: "Germans lead by Germans. French lead by French."
ger.403.c: "Großdeutschland will stretch to the Atlantic."
ger.404.t: "Establish our government"
ger.404.d: "To defend our regime from any attacks from what's left of the Entente we must establish our governmental offices and raise an army to defend them. Our regime is currently weak but over time the French people will accept it."
ger.404.a: "German truly is our friend... right?"
ger.4041.t: "Terrorist bombing damages factory"
ger.4041.d: "A French partisan group, loyal to the Algiers regime, is suspected to be responsible for a bombing in one of our industrial complexes. The bomb was detonated early in the morning and while no casualties have been reported the factory was severely damage. While these terrorists think they can weaken our state with cowardly attacks like this, both the police and military have assured us that they'll be able to stop any further subversive actions."
ger.4041.a: "These cowards will be dealt with soon enough."
ger.405.t: "Terrorist bombing damages factory"
ger.405.d: "A French partisan group, loyal to the Algiers regime, is suspected to be responsible for a bombing in one of our industrial complexes.

ger.406.t: "The Republic is dead. Long live France."
ger.406.d: "With the help of our German allies we have been able to destroy what was left of the French Republic. The civil war is now over and we have we have shown to the world that we are the legitimate French government. Together with Germany we shall bring our nations into a new golden era of wealth and prosperity."
ger.406.a: "The world trembles at the might of the new France."
ger.407.t: "We are home."
ger.407.d: "Our soldiers have returned to their homes as heros and liberators. We have destroyed the illegitimate government of German puppet Jacques Doriot and are ready to reestablish the republic in Paris. Many are celebrating this victory but much work is still needed to be done. The German empire may be wounded but it's still swinging. We must march to Berlin, the heart of the German beast, and destroy it."
ger.407.a: "Long live the republic!"
ger.408.t: "The United Provinces are attacked!"
ger.408.d: "Germany has attacked the neutral Provinces of the low lands. They are trying to flank our defensive position on the Rhine. We must bring the Provinces into our alliance so we can coordinate our strategies and attacks."

ger.409.t: "The Swiss Confederation is attacked!"
ger.409.d: "Germany has attacked the neutral Confederation of Switzerland. They are trying to flank our defensive position on the Rhine and divide our forces form the Italian ones. We must bring the Confederation into our alliance to coordinate our strategies and attacks."
ger.409.a: "Our eastern neighbor must not fall."
ger.410.t: "The Next Frontier?"
ger.410.d: "Regretfully our forces have been defeated, with the Huns now at the gates of Rome. With no allies to rely on, we must now consider escaping, relocating the government to Libya to escape the German occupation. We will reign as a government in exile until we can claim back our land. Whilst many in our government have proposed continuing the fight until the bitter end, some have pleaded for peace to prevail, so as to at least reduce the suffering of the Italian people."
ger.410.a: "Viva l'Italia!"
ger.410.b: "It is over..."
ger.411.t: "Italian Government flees to Tripoli"
ger.411.d: "We've pushed the cowardly, back stabbing Italians past the Eternal City, Rome, and now they've finally surrendered to our great army. The remnants of the Italian government have fled the continent, choosing instead of surrendering like men, to run away like dogs with tails between their legs. We are now the supreme power in Southern Europe, with all nations trembling at the might of Deutschland!.\n\nHowever, this has raised a new question. Do we continue on to Libya? Whilst this may be an appealing choice to the more adventurous part of our government, many pragmatists have urged against such an endeavor as potentially costly as crossing the Mediterranean."
ger.411.a: "They can dry up in the Sahara for all we care."
ger.411.b: "We cannot let them continue the fight!"
ger.413.t: "The fate of Italy"
ger.413.d: "Now that we've conquered Italy we have to decide what to do with the land. We can form a puppet Valkist government under cooperative Italian general, Rudolfo Graziani, cutting the cost of prolonged occupation. We could also, however, continue our occupation and conquer the peninsula entirely."
ger.413.b: "Germans lead by Germans. Italians lead by Italians."
ger.413.c: "Großdeutschland will stretch to the Mediterranean."
ger.414.t: "Establish Administration"
ger.414.d: "The former Government of Italy having fled, forces us to build an entirely new one from scratch, a very unpopular one at that. We will set up our administrations so we can rebuild our broken nation and protect our people."
ger.414.a: "It must be done"
ger.415.t: "Partisans Damage Industry"
ger.415.d: "Even though our new Government is providing for our citizens just as the old one did, we still have partisans and rebels who cling to the dead ideals of the past republic. Terrorists have bombed some of our factories, making them absolutely useless. These rebels need to be put down."
ger.415.a: "Damned Rebels!"
ger.416.t: "Finally at Peace"
ger.416.d: "With the defeat of the false 'Italian' Government in Libya we have proven to the populace that we are the legitimate government. We have shut down the terrorising partisans and now are able to peacefully rebuild our nation. We are finally in a well earned peace."

ger.417.d: "After far too long in exile we have finally taken back our great nation from the German's barbaric Government.

ger.417.a: "Viva Italia!"
ger.418.t: "Expand Ostmark?"
ger.418.d: "Throughout the 19th century and after the Great War several pieces of Hapsburg Austrian land were annexed by Italy. The areas of Venice and Milan have been points of contention between the two nations for nearly a century now. The current question is whether we shall reassert those past claims by expanding Austrian land into Italy or forgetting ideals of long dead monarchies."
ger.418.a: "Respect the old Hapsburg claims"
ger.418.b: "We don't have time to deal with this"
ger.420.t: "Escape to Canada"
ger.420.d: "Germany has invaded and conquered our island, far sooner than we could have ever suspected due to the size of their navy. Many members of the parliament along with the King have fled across the sea to Canada, from where we will lead the Empire in exile, fighting abroad until we take our nation back. We will not stop, we will not surrender until we take Britain and Europe back from the Valkists."
ger.420.a: "We will reclaim our birthright!"
ger.421.t: "British Government flees to Canada"
ger.421.d: "The British Isles are now under German control. To avoid complete defeat much of the government has chosen to run and hide like cowards in there overseas possession of Canada. In a speech to crowds of Ottawa, Edward VIII has stated that 'this is just the beginning of our fight against Germany' Edward would go on to claim 'The brave men and women of the British Empire will not rest until they once again walk on the beaches of Dover, stroll the green fields of Wales and swim in the great lotus of Scotland'. Despite the uplifting tone of his voice it is clear to most that the British situation is lost. Germany is now the undisputed superpower of Europe."
ger.4211.t: "The fate of British Rhodesia"
ger.4211.d: "The fall of the British Isles has left the world in shock. The loss of the worlds largest empire leaves the fate of many nations in limbo. During the Scramble for Africa the British empire forced our nation to abandon it's goal to unite our colonies of Angola and Mozambique by land. Instead the British occupied the territory. This was an embarrassment for our nation but now we have the opportunity to right this wrong. Shall we occupy Rhodesia in the British absence?"
ger.4211.a: "The Pink Map shall live on!"
ger.4211.b: "We don't need to hurt our relations with Britain"
ger.4221.d: "The Portuguese have occupied our colony of Rhodesia severing British Control of the Cape to Cairo railway. While we are in no place to counter this action at the moment we must not forget the treacherous action of the Portuguese"
ger.4212.t: "End of the British Empire?"
ger.4212.d: "The British Isles have fallen into German hands. The fate of the Commonwealth is unknown and even the future of our nation is in jeopardy. Our government is divided between British loyalist who want to continue the war against Germany and nativist Afrikaners who see this as a great opportunity to establish ourselves as an independent state. Whichever faction wins this debate will set South Africa down a path that will be remembered for generations."
ger.4212.a: "Afrikaner faction succeeds"
ger.4212.b: "Loyalists faction succeeds"
ger.4222.d: "The Union of South Africa has declared independence from the Commonwealth and has dropped all diplomatic ties with the Imperial Protection Alliance. South Africa has also taken this opportunity to steal our colonies of Southern Rhodesia and South West Africa. While we are in no place to counter this action at the moment we must not forget this treacherous action of the Afrikaners."
ger.4213.t: "End of the British Empire?"
ger.4213.d: "The British Isles have fallen into German hands. The fate of the Commonwealth is unknown and even the future of our nation is in jeopardy. It is clear to most that the British will not be able to protect the Pacific. We must take control of this disaster and bring the disparate British Colonies of the Pacific under Australian control. This will allow us to better protect them and to unify our strategy. Some within the government have lost hope for the British cause. They argue that the time is now for Australia to declare itself an independent state no longer dependent on the failed British Empire."
ger.4213.a: "We must centralize and secure the Pacific"
ger.4213.c: "Australia is on it's own now"
ger.4213.b: "It's not the time to make such a decision"
ger.4223.d: "Australia has declared itself independent from the British Empire and has cut all diplomatic ties to the Imperial Protection Alliance.

ger.4215.t: "Collapse of The British Empire"
ger.4215.d: "The German Reich has occupied the British Isles, severing the head of the Commonwealth. This puts the fate of most of the British colonies in limbo. For us that leaves the valuable British ports of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the coast of China undefended. We have the opportunity to take these ports, adding great wealth to our own empire. Despite the ambitious attitude of some ministers, many government officials are pro-British, seeing them as one of the pillars to our modernization. Anything to harm our relationship would tarnish this legacy."
ger.4215.a: "These ports will make a fine addition to our Empire"
ger.4215.b: "We must stay on good terms with Britain"
ger.4225.d: "Our former ally of Japan has stolen our Chinese port of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei. It seems that Japan has chosen to abandon the west, asserting it's position as a great power.

ger.4216.d: "The German Reich has occupied the British Isles, severing the head of the Commonwealth. This puts the fate of most of the British colonies in limbo.

ger.4226.d: "Argentinian forces have occupied the Falkland Islands. Currently the fate of the British settlers on the island is unknown but we can be certain that our position in the South Atlantic has been severely weakened. While we are in no place to counter this action at the moment we must not forget this treacherous action of the Argentinians."
ger.4240.d: "The German victory in the British Isles has severely weakened. our ability to manage our colonial possessions. The French have taken this opportunity to occupy it in our absence. The French foreign minister has stated that the French only desire to continue the peaceful operation of the canal and will respect British claims to the territory. Despite this story it is clear that the French nation has gained much influence of prestige in Europe at our expense."
ger.4231.t: "The German Reich has occupied the British Isles, severing the head of the Commonwealth. This puts the fate of most of the British colonies in limbo including Gibraltar. Ever since the Spanish War of Succession the territory of Gibraltar. has been occupied by Britain, despite several attempts to reclaim it, but now the fall of the British Isles gives us the opportunity to settle this once and for all. We have the support of both the Spanish people and government. Shall we reclaim Gibraltar.?"
ger.4231.a: "Of course"
ger.4231.b: "We are in no shape to challenge Britain"
ger.4232.d: "The German victory in the British Isles has severely weakened. our ability to manage our colonial possessions. The Spanish have used this opportunity to occupy our base at Gibraltar. Despite the territory being in British hands for over 200 years the Spanish have used archaic claims as justification to annex the peninsula. We may not be in a position to fight Spain over this but we will never forget this insult against our great Empire"
ger.4217.t: "Securing the British Empire"
ger.4217.d: "The German victory in Europe may be the largest set back the Commonwealth has ever faced but the war must rage on. It will be Canada's duty to protect the Americas from German aggression. To help facilitate this goal some ministers have suggested that we directly claim sovereignty over the British Caribbean.

ger.4219.d: "The British Isles have fallen into German hands. The fate of the Commonwealth is unknown and even the future of our nation is in jeopardy. We must do whatever we can to help secure the Pacific and New Zealand's future but many ministers in parliament argue this may require us cutting ties with Britain.

ger.4230.d: "The German Reich has occupied the British Isles, severing the head of the Commonwealth. This puts the fate of most of the British colonies in limbo including the Suez Canal.

ger.428.t: "Kaiser Wilhelm II found in Switzerland"
ger.428.d: "When Germany faced defeat near the end of the Great War the German Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated his throne and fled to Switzerland. This spelled defeat for the German nation and permanently damaged his reputation with many of his former subjects but despite this some still hold nostalgia for the Kaiser. His controversial legacy has our government split on how to deal with him. Some Valkist ministers believe that being on good terms with the Kaiser will help bolster support from the more conservative elements of the German Reich but [GER.GetLeader] in a rage fulled rant stated 'That traitor left his people for dead when he abdicated!' and 'That man should pay for his crimes!'. This left most of [GER.GetLeader]'s cabinet silent toward the issue."

ger.428.c: "Execute the traitor!"
ger.1012.d: "The German Reich has invited us to a conference to discuss the 'Bohemia question'. The union of Western Slavs is a failed union that has only divided the nations of central Europe. Bohemia was unfairly given Slovakia as a result of the Treaty of Versailles without the consent of the Hungarians and Slovakians who make the up the majority of the population of the territory. Germany promises to give us the territory if we join the their alliance, Stahlpakt, and assist them in dismantling the nation. An alliance with Germany could give us the leverage we need to reclaim the Greater Hungarian territories from Italy, Serbia and Transylvania but [GER.GetLeader] does not seem to be the most trustworthy person. Should we risk the safety of our nation, people and future just for the chance of Carpathian dominance?"
ger.10172.d: "Hungary followed through and joined our side in dealing with Bohemia. With their help we easily crushed the Slavic forces but now they demand control over Slovakia as part of our agreement. While it may have seemed like a good idea at the time many of our own generals believe that an alliance with the Hungarian state would be more of a burden than actually helpful. Just like how Austria failed us in the Great War they worry now that Hungary will do the same. Instead they suggest we should install a puppet regime in Slovakia which we can have full control of and ignore the weak Magyar nation."
ger.10173.d: "Despite giving our full support to Germany's invasion of Bohemia, those traitors in Berlin have refused to give us control of Slovakia, the territory that we fought and died for. Never again shall we support Germany!"
ger.2069.t: "The Fate of Slovakia"
ger.2069.d: "As we come to control the former Bohemia lands known as Slovakia, we find ourselves holding territories of great ethnic tensions and struggle. While directly controlling these territories may be problematic for our government, if we were to grant them titular autonomy as our subjects, under the total guidance of the Reich, of course, we could get some use of their loyalty and men."

gerhun.1.d: "Relations with Hungary has been steadily increasing over the past few months, and they obviously wish to join us in European domination.

##### Decisions #####
GER_german_civilwar: "German unificantion"
GER_german_civilwar_desc: "The post war partition of Germany has left our nation weak and vulnerable. Now millions of Germans live under foreign rule, lead by backwards governments. We should pursue a policy of German unification under any means necessary."
war_kingdom: "Invade the Kingdom of Germany"
war_kingdom_desc: "The British lead Kingdom of Germany is a clear puppet regime hell bent on returning Germany to a state of monarchy. This is not only an insult to all the Germans who died in fighting in the Kaiser lead Great War but to all Germans who seek freedom for justice and liberty for their family. We must oust this false king to unite Germany"
war_republic: "Invade the Republic of Germany"
war_republic_desc: "The French lead German Republic is just a modern Confederation of the Rhine. As long as France has any type of sovereignty over Germany, Europe isn't truly free. We must destroy this false republic to unite Germany"
war_soviet: "Invade the German SSR"
war_soviet_desc: "The Soviet lead German SSR is just a ploy to spread socialism to all the nations of Europe. Stability on the continent can never be guaranteed as long as the red menace has a foothold in the heart of western civilization. We must destroy Socialism and all those who spread it."
war_bavaria: "Invade the German Federation"
war_bavaria_desc: "The US lead German Federation is the latest example of US imperialism into Europe. Such domination from Washington is a clear violation of a nation's right to self determination. To curb American influence into Europe we must attack any foothold they try to take."

Some ministers have suggested we create a unified German Republic with out zone but while a strong German ally could be of great benefit for us and the Entente it may not be worth the risk of having a neighbor capable of invading us once again which is why some minsters have drafted a counter plan of dividing our zone into smaller states dependant of France for survival."

Our government is split between supporting the French plan for Germany and the British plan. The German Republic is more alligned with our policy of self-determination but it may be better to be on good terms with London. In the middle of this debate there are other's in our government who support plans of establishing a German Federation under US guidance.

As per our agreement with France we have total authority in our zone and as such we should use this oppurtunity to liberate the Workers of Germany. Establishing a socialist state in Germany, home of Karl Marx, would help give our ideology legitamacy on the world stage. Some in our government though wish not to upset the western powers, especially France. Returning this zone to France would help maintain good relations. Obviously this is revisionism and should be ignored but the threat of Germany shouldn't be glossed over.

Speaking on the behalf of German foreign minister Alfred Rosenberg, The delegates have promised the immediate disarmment of all German units and the surrender of all government officials in the country. The status of the German Fuhrer, [GER.GetLeader], has not been confirmed by the german delegates but it is suspected he has left the country and is in hiding.

valkyrie.1.t: "The Winter Plot"
valkyrie.1.d: "It was a cold morning in Berlin, at least, colder than usual. But that didn't stop people from going to work to gain their livelihood... or from plotting. In a frozen squat outside of town a dozen men united in goal and purpose are preparing to bring down the regime that took hold of Germany years ago and has since then done everything in it's power to destroy her heart. Plans were being drawn, contacts and names listed, weapons checked and re-checked, checkpoint passes verified for the smallest default.\n "This week is the one, J announced to all of them, it's now or never ! Plan is simple, in a couple days Dressler is gonna quit Berlin for his Winter residence in Bavaria, security will be less tight as his guard are getting shifted and we got a couple of people in that will make passing the checkpoints easier. It's a simple matter of getting in, shooting everything between us and him and then blowing the bastard's hea-"\n Before he could finish, someone started knocking on the door. Fear suddenly took hold of the group. One man picked up a Luger on the table and loaded it, while J, slowly made his way to the door 'Is it the end ? We were, so close yet so far away alas' he thought while turning the knob.\n What he saw froze him as if Medusa pierced him with her cursed eyes, an officer of the Wehrmacht ! flanked by two soldiers no less, where holding a big crate and were waiting outside.\n 'Quickly, you must allow me to enter at once' the military man says.\n Astonished by the turn of events J lets them in.\n "You must be Unteroffizer Josheph, listen what you need to know is that someone big, well let just say benefactor is offering you better means for your ... future actions, so use them well. Of course you never heard of him nor me, and this talk never took place. That will be all'.\n And as quickly as he went in, he stormed out. The small room froze and seconds who felt like minutes passed... until someone gathered enough courage to open the crate. What he saw, what they all saw was the axe that will shop the snake's head, the room previously silent cheered at once."
valkyrie.1.a: "The right men, in the wrong place can make all the difference"
valkyrie.1.b: "The plot was exposed to the Fuhrer before it even hatched!"

valkyrie.2.t: "Gunshots in Berlin"
valkyrie.2.d: "Last night, A group of soldiers from the seemingly loyal Berlin Guard have what it seemed successful stormed into Dressler's apartments after engaging and killing the TST troops stationed to protect him. Then in a fit of rage shot and threw him out of the window and into the streets in a most gruesome scene before surrendering to the reinforcements after running out of ammunition. Minutes latter, they were executed on the spot, taunting the aimed rifles with a smile. It seems that these men have with their courage or madness changed the fate of this once pround nation once more, irrevocably, for better or worse."
valkyrie.2.a: "Germany bleeds."

valkyrie.3.t: "The Army Seizes Control of the Country"
valkyrie.3.d: "All around the country, the Wehrmacht mobilized and stormed both Berlin and others major population centers crushing any dissent and instauring Martial law.\nAs an eerie silence establishes across the country, a radio broadcast is being voiced in the airs it is..."
valkyrie.3.a: "It is general Von Seeckt and his clique of generals!"
valkyrie.3.b: "Air Marshall Hermann Goering ?!"


valkyrie.4.t: "Anarchy in Germany"
valkyrie.4.d: "With Dressler's death, Germany finds itself without leader nor central authority, riots are errupting overwealming the police while many military units defect to protect the crowds from the Valkist death squads resulting in shoot outs in many major cities. It has come to the point where the newly established Valkist council has asked what is left of the army to help crush the dissent before total collapse, yet the radios and the High command remains silent."
valkyrie.4.b: "A power struggle errupted in Werhmacht but has been resolved!"
valkyrie.4.a: "The country collapses !"

valkyrie.5.t: "Von Seeckt's speech"
valkyrie.5.d: " '... and so, We do not come as destroyers of liberty or as prophets of a new world order, but as guardians of an age, an age that many have long since forgotten in these trying times. Where the nation wasn't devided by such extreme and barbaric ideologies but united by God and the king of which exerced his devine mandate, and by a constitution that protected the people from tyranny and not tyranny from the people. And so, may we remember this day as the day where true peace and true justice came upon the boiling heart of this nation of ours' ."
valkyrie.5.a: "If God is with us than who is against us ?"

valkyrie.6.t: "Goering's Speech"
valkyrie.6.d: " '... I am before anything a patriot, I did not fight a World war for Germany just to let it sink into the depths of hell in the hand of the Valkists. What I did and what some people may interpret as treason is an act not motivated by self-intrest or power, but by the will to save a nation that was crashing down on itself, and I will keep on fighting with the same sprit as before so that Germans, all Germans, may live a life of happiness in a prosperous country that assured itself in the battlefield that is Europe."
valkyrie.6.a: "My honour is loyalty, toward Germany !"

valkyrie.7.t: "The Blue Max Tour"
valkyrie.7.d: "In a daring bet, Reichspräsident Hermann Goering went train touring into all major urban centers of Germany to meet with the locals with a clear objective in mind, that of rallying Germany behind this new regime of his and to give to the latter a more human face. It is clear that the tour was a success as the Reichspräsident, with his quick jokes and charming personality touched the heart of many Germans who see him now more of a kind leader than a boasting dictator the likes of Dressler."
valkyrie.7.a: "Sehr Gut !"

valkyrie.8.t: "A New Mouvement, For a New Germany"
valkyrie.8.d: "As the army collapsed on its self due to power struggle. The riots by civilian population led by city workers and other blue collars overwhelmed both the police and military forces on a nationwide level. The Valkist government without any power to back it up followed suite and broke. In a most shocking turn of event, faced with lawlessness and food shortages, city councils formed around pre-existing illegal and underground trade unions. It seems that Germany is becoming Red."
valkyrie.8.a: "We shall be free, just as our fathers were"

valkyrie.9.t: "Reintroducing the Constitution of 1871"
valkyrie.9.d: "After the end of the Weltkrieg and the toppling of the monarchy the Allied powers forced Germany to change its constitution from one that guarantees freedom and stability to one of the most inefficient political system that ended promoting extremism and was copied from the French nonetheless. It is time to get rid of this shameful paper and return to the roots of our greatness."
valkyrie.9.a: "A constitution guarantees stability, at least."

valkyrie.10.t: "Reinstating the nobility"
valkyrie.10.d: "There was nothing more shameful in the Reichstag's history than to stab in the back the nobles that served Germany so dearly for so long and gave everything for it, including, their sons' blood. When the Kaiserreich was toppled, they lost everything they had, including their ancestral lands, to socialist regimes and were forced to flee and start a new life. Many of them became successful businessmen while another leased their military skills to foreign powers which they became citizens of. Nonetheless, we must reverse the damage done by the previous illegitimate governments and open the door to those who want to return and reinstate all their titles to the fullest."
valkyrie.10.a: "We do not turn our backs to those who served."
valkyrie.10.b: "... And certainly not if it's also good for business"

valkyrie.11.t: "Marriage of the Deposed"
valkyrie.11.d: "Habsburg royalty from various countries have convened over the last week in celebration of a historic marriage that, in many ways, has shaken the historical European royal institution to its very core. A marriage between Crown Prince Wilhelm , the lead issue of the House of Hohenzollern, and Archduchess Rosa von Österreich, one of the the foremost duchesses of the House of Habsburg, were wed in Munich, Bavaria over the weekend. While both houses forbid, unofficially or officially, the marraige of legitimate offspring to unlanded suitors, this marriage occurred at the behest of both houses and with the support of the new German state. While both spouses are de jure titled, it is clear that the Junta in charge of Germany wants to restore some kind of Monarchic rule and place the legitimate heir on the throne. What this could represent is monumental..."
valkyrie.11.a: "Whoooo, they are so charming!"

valkyrie.12.t: "Kingdoms with no Kings"
valkyrie.12.d: "In our efforts to rekindle the Germany of old we have done much to dissolve the Valkist institutions and replace them with our own, yet, there is still one major issue. In what shape will we restore the old Kingdoms of Germany ? Some people in our government argue for a full-blown restoration of all titles and powers, others prefer to limit them by introducing government supervision, while a significant part of the population and a minority of the government prefer local constitutions to protect citizen rights. In any cases, the debate rages on in the cabinet..."
valkyrie.12.a: "Full-on restoration, it is their birthright after all."
valkyrie.12.b: "Introduce government supervision, we never know."
valkyrie.12.c: "What are we, a dictatorship? Let the people decide!"

valkyrie.13.t: "Accession to the throne"
valkyrie.13.d: "Everything is ready, the wheels of history are moving once more. The Valkists are either dead or emprisoned and so are most of the extremists. We have won the fight for Germany's soul but there is only one more thing left the Junta hasn't decided yet. Should the powers of the upcoming Kaiser be limited to avoid what the events of the First Weltkrieg or should it be reinforced as the democratic parlementarian system of the Weimar Republic proved to be weak and ineffective to hold extremism ?"
valkyrie.13.a: "Long Live the Kaiser ! Three Hussahs !"
valkyrie.13.b: "Long Live the Kaiser and his Subjects !"

valkyrie.14.t: "Erste Parlamentswahl"
valkyrie.14.d: "The streets are filled with joy and excitement! Indeed, after the ascension of the Kaiser and the de-valkization of the country, a general election has been organized where every man and women is free to participate and vote to elect his Majesty's government, from worker to soldier to doctor. And now in this very moment the ballots are being emptied, the votes counted and the results are..."
valkyrie.14.a: "The Christian conservatives !"
valkyrie.14.b: "The Liberal coalition !"

valkyrie.15.t: "One Nation, Two Faces" 
valkyrie.15.d: "As Lincold once said 'A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand' and there is a good reason for that, as two pulling forces that are opposite of each other will inevitably bring the whole structure down, and this is the case of Germany now. There are two forces in this country being, us, the new lawful government of Germany representing the will of the people, and, the military, a melting pot of brainwashed Valkists, patriots, normal hardworking men and aristocrats. All of them form the sword and shield of Germany and swore to defend it from external and internal threats. Unfortunately for us they view us as just that, a threat, and as so are actively working to destroy us. Luckily, our general popularity is stopping them from enacting their plans and gives us enough momentum to decisively act. In that we have two plans, one is to arrest the top brass that is judged too dangerous, and, to dissolve the army into regional, national guards under the control of the local Länders. The other less painful option would be to compromise with them and achieve a point of mutual respect and coexistence by safeguarding the Army's tradition and position within Germany. At last a choice has to be made lest Brothers turn against Brothers yet again."

valkyrie.16.d: "A new day rises upon Germany and her hard working soldiers, but this one is a little different than others, for the Bavarian man now protects Bavaria and the Prussian Prussia and the Badanese Baden. Yes, it is in fact a new day, where each German is close to his community and his loved ones, whom he protects with the gun and helmet they made for him, and he knows deep inside his heart, that his cause is just and rightful, that is, to fight, protect, and die if necessary for the soil and people that saw him grow up and become the man he is now."
valkyrie.16.a: "Men of Germany protect what is yours"

valkyrie.17.t: "A Federal Army ?"
valkyrie.17.d: "Although the new Guardsmen are doing a fine job at protecting our territorial integrity from internal and external enemies, there is a rising question among the Officers and Majors of this Guard about how would offensive operations be enacted let alone coordinate without any central command or general staff. And how about supplies, food, cared for the wounded? As so, two plans have been drawn, one by the Werhmacht veterans who suggest to federalize the multiple Guards into a... federal army, while the other made by the newest generation of officers propose the creation of a central command that reunites all the different Guards and provides the logistical support needed while safeguarding local initiative and autonomy, both these propositions are being studied seriously by the government and conclutions are being drawn."
valkyrie.17.a: "Federalize The National Guards"
valkyrie.17.b: "Reform is the way to go"


valkyrie.18.t: "The Enemy of my Enemy is my Friend"
valkyrie.18.d: "Britain our old enemy. Large, rich, powerful. Yet weak and rife with revolts and discontempt, but most importantly diplomatically isolated. Indeed to the South her faithful 'ally' France joined arms with the perfidious Italians who have for the longest time threatened the Old Lion's positions in the Mediterranean, while out East the United States and Japan have worked to break Britain's position over Asia. Albion therefore finds herself besieged by many enemies and with no other allies but her unreliant colonies. A situation that can work to Germany's advantage. After all, don't we both share the same goals and foes ?"
valkyrie.18.a: "Let us then extend the olive branch to them"


valkyrie.19.t: "A letter from Westminster"
valkyrie.19.d: "...as of now his Majesty's parliament accepts Germany's request of an alliance against Britain and Germany's common enemies and vows to fight side to side and deploy all means to end the threat they pose on both internal and external stability. From now forth Britain and Germany are allies."
valkyrie.19.a: "I didn't know Germans could be diplomats"

valkyrie.20.t: "Comradship of Nations"
valkyrie.20.d: "Germany's position in Europe is precarious to say the least, we are alone, surrounded by hostile capitalist regimes who pray, waiting for the occasion to destroy this New, Socialist experiment of ours, as they have tried to do to so with the Soviet Union. That is why we have decided to enter into talks with the later, even if our ideological and cultural differences are remarkable. Joining our efforts by creating a common political and economic alliance against the hostile powers of Europe will allow us to cooperate on a level never seen before, allowing us quasi-complete autonomy as Soviet agriculture will feed Germany and German industry will supply the Soviet Union."
valkyrie.20.a: "Let us unite in the hope of a better future"

valkyrie.21.t: "Birth of the Comintern"
valkyrie.21.d: "After hours of deliberation the Politburo agreed that an alliance between Germany and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics would be beneficial and signed the treaty of mutual friendship, where we agree to recognize it as the heir of the Russian Empire, engage in open trade and most importantly protect it in case of war. In return the USSR agrees to do the same. As of now we have entered into an alliance with them."
valkyrie.21.a: "A great success for the Socialist cause !"

valkyrie.22.t: "Hands-Off Zones"
valkyrie.22.d: "Although Britain is willing to trust the German government, it is still anxious about the idea that we might seize Belgian and Dutch ports for military use if war is declared on France, and that, if said alliance served its purpose and that Germany might decide or find itself as an enemy of Britain once more, those very ports may harbor warships that will prey upon British shores the likes of which happened in the Weltkrieg."
valkyrie.22.a: "No Schlieffenplan this time"


valkyrie.23.t: "The King's visit to Germany"
valkyrie.23.d: "Today Edward the 8th King of Great Britain of Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas but also Defender of the Faith and Emperor of India landed with the British delegation in Berlin's Tempelhof Airport where they received a warm welcome from the German greeting party which then drove him away to the Berlin Palace where they dined with the Kaiser himself and the highest dignitaries of Germany. This visit is a great boon to our mutual relations as the King's tour to Berlin will surely diminish Germano and Anglophobia in our respective countries therefore reinforcing our alliance and the willingness of our people to cooperate."
valkyrie.23.a: "No hunting trips this time, we never know"


valkyrie.24.d: "The German government has invited our nation to a military exercise. During the Great War our forces fought each other for nearly 5 years, both sides never able to gain the advantage over the other. It took until 1919 for our forces to overcome the German onslaught. It is clear that we both can learn much from each other but the scars of the Great War are still felt in our military staff, many of whom are wary of Germany."

valkyrie.25.d: "Britain has agreed to participate in a military exercise with us. Both sides will hopefully gain much needed experience in modern warfare from this. It also seems that the British may be interested in further cooperation with our nation."

valkyrie.26.d: "Officers and men from both nations have arrived in Germany for the Anglo-German military exercise. Both sides will be put under pressure as there soldiers, vehicles and officers are tested in mock combat exercises. The Great War gave hint to the power of combined arms but it'll have to be shown if those lessons stuck."

valkyrie.27.d: "Germany has offered us a trade deal in which they will trade to us heavy vehicle equipment at below market value if we in return sell them our naval equipment. While this deal would help develop our land forces our naval officers are wary of giving any support to a possible rival's naval"

valkyrie.28.d: "The British government has agreed to sell us valuable naval equipment in return for our heavy vehicle equipment. This deal no only brings our two nations together but will greatly help our own nation develop a powerful navy."

valkyrie.29.t: "The Czech Problem"
valkyrie.29.d: "Since the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the birth of the Czech state, the Germans of the Sudetes -and of Bohemia in general- have been exposed to many persecutions and repressions and their rights have been crushed in an attempt to enforce Czech culture and language upon them. This is an unforgivable act one that cannot go without repercutions. If the Czechs cannot safeguard the well being of the German communities then we shall." #this event is for Germany
valkyrie.29.a: "Demand the Sudentendlands !"
valkyrie.29.b: "The Czechs must submit !"

valkyrie.30.t: "The Germans want the Sudentenlands"
valkyrie.30.d: "The German ambassador in Prague has delivered us a most simple message, either cede the Sudentendlands or face the consquences" #this event is for Czechia
valkyrie.30.a: "Fine give them their damn lands" #starts event 32 / Event chained finish Sudentenlands are transfered
valkyrie.30.b: "This is sacred Czech land !" #starts event 33/ Czechia refuses to give Sudentendlands, situation fires up

valkyrie.31.t: "The German Ultimatum"
valkyrie.31.d: "The German ambassador has delivered us a baffling message today, either Prague gives away both its foreign independence and the Sudentenlands or face making us practically a puppet of Germany in all but in name or face military repercution, the country is in rage and so are our politicians neverthless this might avoid us total annihilation by the hands of the Germans."
valkyrie.31.a: "Never shall we surrender without a fight !"
valkyrie.31.b: "Accept their demands, so that our children may live in peace."

valkyrie.32.t: "The Sudentendlands are Ours !"
valkyrie.32.d: "The Czechs in their infinite wisdom have agreed to return our lands preferring to avoid all possible military confrontation with us. As of today, the Sudentendlands are German once more."
valkyrie.32.a: "A wise choice"

valkyrie.33.t: "The Czechs refuse !"
valkyrie.33.d: "The Czechs have not only refused to cede what is considered by many Germans national oppressed territories, but have also asked our ambassador to Prague 'to piss off or be executed tomorrow by a firing squad'. These are grave insults to not only our Government but also to the German people, they must and will not go unpunished."
valkyrie.33.a: "A foolish decision"
valkyrie.33.b: "They must have hidden allies otherwise why push it as far as they did ?"

valkyrie.34.t: "The Czechs are under attack !"
valkyrie.34.d: "The Germans have attacked our Czechs brothers for the Sudentendlands what are we gonna do ?"
valkyrie.34.a: "Interviene !"
valkyrie.34.b: "Let it slide"

valkyrie.35.t: "Poland Intervenes !"
valkyrie.35.d: "The Perfidious Poles have come to help the Czechs against us and our rightful war to liberate the German people, what seemed at first to be a limited diplomatic arm wrestling has spiraled out into a massive war along our Eastern border. The fate of all Germans is now at stake."
valkyrie.35.a: "We shall not go gentle into that good night."

valkyrie.36.t: "Crisis in Prague"
valkyrie.36.d: "Unsuprisingly the Czechs have refused to hand over the control of both their foreign policy and the German Sudentendlands, they have locked off all diplomatic channels and imprisoned all personnel from the German embassy. The situation is turning sour quickly. We must decide what to do at once, lest we turn into the laughing stock of Europe."
valkyrie.36.a: "The Czechs shot first !"
valkyrie.36.b: "A total blackout ? they must have an ace in their sleeves"


valkyrie.37.t: "Response from Prague"
valkyrie.37.d: "In a most surprising turn of events the Czech government has agreed to not only hand over our rightful territorial claims, but also to become in practical terms a vassal. It is indeed a great day for our nation as one of the most baffling terms of Versaille has been broken and a part of our people liberated from the grips of foreign oppression, nevertheless we must not let our guard down as there is still much more to do."
valkyrie.37.a: "We did what Dressler couldn't"

valkyrie.38.t: "Anshluss of Austria"
valkyrie.38.d: "Austria has since the death of the Austro-Hungarian empire been in political turmoil, the multiple parties clashing for power over the well being of their citizens did not ease this situation. One that shows the mistake that was the birth of this pitiful state, which couldn't join Germany under the conditions of this damn treaty. But no more! Tomorrow we shall cross the border and reunite peacefully with our brethren, and this time no one will stop us."
valkyrie.38.a: "Forward ! For Germany !"

valkyrie.39.t: "The German army march on Vienna !"
valkyrie.39.d: "The German army has started a march in Vienna instead of defending the country, many Austrian soldiers have defected to the other side and joined them, the country is in a complete meltdown, what do we do?"
valkyrie.39.a: "The state fails !"
valkyrie.39.b: "Italy intervenes"

valkyrie.40.t: "Austria Dissolves"
valkyrie.40.d: "It seems that our march on Vienna was a success with most of the Austrian army joining us, while the country, paralyzed, couldn't mount a response in time. As of now Austria is German."
valkyrie.40.a: "Wonderful"

valkyrie.41.t: "The Germans are marching on Vienna"
valkyrie.41.d: "It seems the German army is marching on Vienna with little or no resistance on the part of the Austrians we must act quickly lest we get a border with the Teutons"
valkyrie.41.a: "March on Austria at once !"

valkyrie.42.t: "Italy has seized Southern Austria !"
valkyrie.42.d: "Those vile, disgusting traitorous Italians have preemptively launched their own invasion of Austria and have since established a puppet government in the Southern parts of the country which is clearly a buffer state in all but name, we must act an fast!"
valkyrie.42.a: "Denounce the invasion and embargo Italy"
valkyrie.42.b: "War it is !"

valkyrie.43.t: "The Polish Strip"
valkyrie.43.d: "In the last act of our desperate fight against the Allie powers during the first Weltkrieg, the Poles rebelled against our benevolent rule and ripped from Germany the regions of Posen and Masuren. An illegitimate takeover that was cemented by the treaty of Versaille which not only gave them more of our land, but also refused our people the right of self determination, they were so keen on imposing. Although crushing Poland would be rewarding, some people in the general staff disagree on the basis that the Poles would serve as a fantastic meat shield against the Soviet Union, one we could guarantee... or fund with weapon."
valkyrie.43.a: "Fine, how about enough weapons to equip an army ?"
valkyrie.43.b: "How about a defensive alliance against the USSR ?"
valkyrie.43.c: "Germans fight better, we'll prove that now"

valkyrie.44.t: "An Army for a State ?"
valkyrie.44.d: "The Germans have approched us with a treaty, enought guns to equip and army for their Poznan and Mazuria, what shall we do ?"
valkyrie.44.a: "Accept"
valkyrie.44.b: "Refuse"

valkyrie.45.t: "German Protection for Territories"
valkyrie.45.d: "The Germans have approched us with a treaty, a guarentee against Eastern Invasion for their Poznan and Mazuria, what shall we do ?"
valkyrie.45.a: "Accept"
valkyrie.45.b: "Refuse"

valkyrie.46.t: "Poznan or War"
valkyrie.46.d: "The Germans have approched us with an ultimatum, either the pre-1914 borders are to be enforced or Germany would enforce its demand militarly, what do we do ?"
valkyrie.46.a: "Capitulate"
valkyrie.46.b: "Refuse"

valkyrie.47.t: "Poland has refused our offer"
valkyrie.47.d: "The Poles have refused our generous offer to hand over our territories and receive compensations, it seems that war is on the horizon."
valkyrie.47.a: "War it is"
valkyrie.47.b: "Let's focus on the West instead"

valkyrie.48.t: "The Polish accept our offer"
valkyrie.48.d: "In return for a sizeable stack of Infantry equipment, the Poles have accepted to transfer the provinces we demanded. War has been avoided, but at a large material cost."
valkyrie.48.a: "They better not turn these guns on us"

valkyrie.49.t: "The Polish accept our offer"
valkyrie.49.d: "In return for the guarantee that Germany will join Poland against possible future Soviet invasion, the Poles have accepted to transfer the provinces we demanded, war has been avoided for now."
valkyrie.49.a: "Diplomacy has won this time"

valkyrie.50.t: "The Polish capitulated"
valkyrie.50.d: "The Poles in the face of German military might have capitulated and agreed to return our provinces, we won't be marching to Warsaw for now, but at least we got what we asked for"
valkyrie.50.a: "Cannonboat diplomacy at it's finest"

valkyrie.51.t: "The Germans of Holstein"
valkyrie.51.d: "On the eve of the Welkrieg's end the Allies in their infinite wisdom have decided that Denmark, a country that didn't even fight during the war, should not only be rewarded by the transfer of Schleswig-Holstein but also by the annexation of all of Hamburg to said province ! Unsuprisingly, what followed was a period of deep trouble and rebellion that took its toll on the Danish state and and its people. That is why we have issued an official request for the return of said mismanaged provinces, for the mutual benefice of both our nations." 
valkyrie.51.a: "There is only one right answer"
valkyrie.51.b: "Did you know that the Berlin-Copenhague flight is only two hours ?"

valkyrie.52.t: "German Ultimatum"
valkyrie.52.d: "Today the Germans delivered us a message, or in other words an ultimatum, they want Holstein back and they have the British with them, this is a poor situation we find ourselves in with the recent events that have passed lately. Maybe by giving them the damn province will we find peace yet again ?"
valkyrie.52.a: "Give in"
valkyrie.52.b: "The answer is no"

valkyrie.53.t: "Denmark Agrees"
valkyrie.53.d: "The Danes have accepted the return of Schleswig-Holstein to Germany. It is a great day for us as a major city a port and a canal have been reclaimed without firing a shot. But all is not bright as there are still Communist rebellions to be dealt with and administration to be homogenized."
valkyrie.53.a: "Am sure everything will return to normality"

valkyrie.54.t: "Denmark Refuses !"
valkyrie.54.d: "Those Danish fools have refused the return of Schleswig and Holstein even with the British backing us! This bad joke has become a scandal nationwide with many people demanding action to be taken and war to be declared. We shall see if the Danes have what it takes to fight."
valkyrie.54.a: "Did you know that the British annexed Zanzibar in under thirty minutes ?"

valkyrie.55.t: "The Rheinland"
valkyrie.55.d: "Rich in mineral resources and industry and populated by Germans, the Rheinland since the end of the 18th century was a part of Germany. Nevertheless, this didn't stop the Allies and notably the perfidious French from occupying it after the end of the Weltkrieg at first and then re-arranging the local administration to form a quasi-state backed up by the French military. Luckily, we have many options to deal with this delicate situation, first we could support the many German Freikorps that ultimately stayed loyal to the idea of a united Germany and provoke an insurrection to seize the nation or parts of it, we could also organize a referendum if the French allow it or send an ultimatum threatening them with military invasion, altought the changes for that  succeeding are slim for the latter. In any cases we much choose wisely or face the consequences of our failures... or successes."
valkyrie.55.a: "Let's try covert operations for once"
valkyrie.55.b: "A referendum, for peace"
valkyrie.55.c: "Send that Ultimatum, we'll bleed the French this time"

valkyrie.56.t: "Funding the Freikorps"
valkyrie.56.d: "We have decided to fund a rebellion under the nose of the French along the Rhein river. Nevertheless, we must also choose how much funding should go on the other side of the border as our industry is limited and the need of our armed forces are great. Guns, artillery, maybe some light tanks can be smuggled and would greatly help against the up-coming fight for the control of the Rhein while avoiding an all out war."
valkyrie.56.a: "We'll see what can we spare"
valkyrie.56.b: "Don't we have some old artillery pieces to spare ?"
valkyrie.56.c: "If they dream it, they have it"

valkyrie.57.t: "Red Rhein Insurrection"
valkyrie.57.d: "Last night troops loyal to Germany have rebelled against the Franco-Rheinish government along the Rhein river. After securing the right bank and the city of Essen with it, the Freikorps seized and then entrenched themselves in Köln waiting for a French counterattack which happened at dawn. The fighting was bloody according to reports, as French troops cleared city blocks with tanks and artillery. Lacking heavy equipment, the defenders retreated to Essen and blew the bridges, cutting off any possible French attacks. As of now it seems that conflict ended as the French command doesn't want to engage in a costly river assault and with Reichwehr troops mobilizing to reinforce the spent Freikorps."
valkyrie.57.a: "At what cost ?"

valkyrie.58.t: "Red Rhein Insurrection"
valkyrie.58.d: "Last night troops loyal to Germany have rebelled against the Franco-Rheinish government along the Rhein river. After securing the right bank and the city of Essen with it, the Freikorps seized parts of the left bank and entrenched themselves along the city of Köln waiting for a French counterattack which happened at dawn. The fighting was bloody according to reports, as French troops assaulted the rebel positions, artillery rained on both sides claiming many lives. Ultimately the French attack was unsuccessful as they did not expect a heavily armed resistance.At last the spent French forces retreated from the Rhein into Mosseland expecting a German attack which did not materialize as both sides were exhausted. It seems the battle for the control of the Rhein was won by Germany as Reichwehr troops are currently moving to annex the region."
valkyrie.58.a: "Three Hussahs for Germany !"

valkyrie.59.t: "Red Rhein Insurrection"
valkyrie.59.d: "Last night troops loyal to Germany have rebelled against the Franco-Rheinish government along the Rhein river. After securing the right bank and the city of Essen with it, the Freikorps seized the left bank and advanced into the unprepared French positions, the result unsuprisingly was a massacre as the tanks we supplied to the rebels plunged through French lines inflicting important casualties. Unfortunately, before our loyalists could've crossed into Mosseland, the retreating French forces blew off the bridges, making any future attacks painfully costly in term men and material. In any case, we have won the battle for the Rheinland while proving to the French that the Germans are still a force to be reckoned with."
valkyrie.59.a: "The German eagle hunts yet again"

valkyrie.60.t: "The Rheinish Referundum"
valkyrie.60.d: "In our desire to avoid conflict with the French and to legitimize our takeover of the Rheinland we have decided that the best solution would be a referendum, so that the people may choose if they want to join us or not. Nevertheless, for that to happen the French must allow it to happen, this is why we should send them an official demand lest we loose the legitimacy of it."
valkyrie.60.a: "Send it"

valkyrie.61.t: "Germany demands a referendum"
valkyrie.61.d: "Germany demands referendum over the fate of the Rheinland, should we accept or denie them the rights to do it ?"
valkyrie.61.a: "accept"
valkyrie.61.b: "denie them"

valkyrie.62.t: "Rhine referendum"
valkyrie.62.d: "The French and Germans have decided a referendum which is on going right now and the results are..."
valkyrie.62.a: "Re-attachement to Germany"
valkyrie.62.b: "Independism"

valkyrie.63.t: "France Agrees"
valkyrie.63.d: "The French have agreed to organize a referendum over the Rheinland's sovereignty, it is a great diplomatic victory as possible conflict has been avoided for now, but there is still the uncertainty of the results that are yet to come..."
valkyrie.63.a: "There is nothing to worry about"

valkyrie.64.t: "France refuses !"
valkyrie.64.d: "The French have refused to let us organize a referendum on the question of the Rheinland's attachment to Germany, by doing this they let us no choice but to declare war on them."
valkyrie.64.a: "It has come to this"

valkyrie.65.t: "The Rheinland says Yes !"
valkyrie.65.d: "The vote results have come out and they are positive! It is a great day as the people of the Rhein have the votes for reunification to the motherland, the French are backing out into their fortress in Elsasse while we reclaim their military installations as such, as of now the Rheinland is German once more."
valkyrie.65.a: "War has been avoided, for now at least"

valkyrie.66.t: "The Rheinland says No!"
valkyrie.66.d: "The vote results have come out and they are negative! It is obvious that the votes were manipulated to bar German reunification and we shall have none of it."
valkyrie.66.a: "The Rheinland has, is, and shall always be German !"

valkyrie.67.t: "German Ultimatum"
valkyrie.67.d: "The Germans want the Rheinland back and they back this with military might we can either give in our refuse but that will probably mean that war is on the horizon"
valkyrie.67.a: "Give in"
valkyrie.67.b: "Refuse"

valkyrie.68.t: "The French capitulate"
valkyrie.68.d: "In the face of German might the French decided to retreat from the Rheinland into their little fortress in Elsasse, the Rheinish government has been dissolved and incorporated into Germany just as their army. West Germany has been reunified... mostly."
valkyrie.68.a: "Everything has it's time"

valkyrie.69.t: "The French resist"
valkyrie.69.d: "France has refused to withdraw from the German Rhein and has since then engaged in the construction of a series of fortification along the left bank of the Rhein river, it is clear that the French want to hold on at all costs to their dominion over the Germans. We must act fast before we loose initiative."
valkyrie.69.a: "War shall be the solution"

valkyrie.70.t: "Austrian revolution"
valkyrie.70.d: "Austria has since the death of the Austro-Hungarian empire been in political turmoil, the multiple parties clashing for power over the well being of their citizens did not ease this situation, that is why, with the Austrian Workers's help we will overthrow the government and finally unite the German workers."
valkyrie.70.a: "Germans of Europe unite !"

valkyrie.71.t: "The Communists revolt !"
valkyrie.71.d: "The Communists have started a march on Vienna instead of defending the country many Austrian soldiers have defected to the other side and joined them, the country is in a complete metdown, what do we do ?"
valkyrie.71.a: "The state fails !"
valkyrie.71.b: "Italy intervenes"

valkyrie.72.t: "Italy has seized Southern Austria !"
valkyrie.72.d: "While the Austrian workers in Vienna, where revolting and overthrowing the bourgeois government, the Italian state intervened to protect its northern border in case of future military conflict with us and has established what is in practice a buffer state."
valkyrie.72.a: "Denounce the invasion and embargo Italy"
valkyrie.72.b: "We will not stand for this !"

valkyrie.73.t: "Bring the Revolution to Denmark"
valkyrie.73.d: "Denmark at first glance seems peaceful and welcoming, but we German workers know what hides behind this supposed innocence and have since the end of the first Welkrieg paid a steep price for this discovery, countless of our brothers and sisters lie, oppressed by the Danish reactionaries who have gladly sent many of their own sons to die in a land that is foreign to them. But tomorrow this will change at last, with the backing of the Soviet Union we will invade Denmark, liberating everyone, and, in the process, ending the Danish old order and bringing to their people true Democracy." 
valkyrie.73.a: "Hopefully the damages of the war will be limited"

valkyrie.74.t: "For the Socialist Cause ?"
valkyrie.74.d: "It seems that our... ambitions to bring the revolution to the Danube didn't go unnoticed. As tension heightened between us and the Bourgois states we wish to liberate, certain revolutionary groups wish to join our cause, provided with guns and ammunition they will rise up and help us defeat our enemies and establish Socialism over much of Central Europe. Surely this is an initiative we should encourage."
valkyrie.74.a: "A welcomed surprise"
valkyrie.74.b: "They are not worth our time"

valkyrie.75.t: "For the Socialist Cause !"
valkyrie.75.d: "With most of the Reactionaries's military mobilized to go fight us their internal operation system has been greatly weakened. The Socialist rebels we have previously funded have seized this occasion to strike, and have since then establish control over strategic regions all over Central Europe that will certainly help us in our war effort one way or another."
valkyrie.75.a: "Alone we are weak but together we are strong"

valkyrie.76.t: "The war for Europe's soul"
valkyrie.76.d: "With France and Italy being out of the picture for now and with the backing of our Soviet brothers, we can initiate an invasion of Central Europe and topple the decadent regimes that oppress the Slavic and Magyar workers. There will be sweat, tears and blood, but at the end the star of Socialism will shine through the Danube."
valkyrie.76.a: "The wave of socialism cannot be stemmed !"

valkyrie.77.t: "The Rheinish Question"
valkyrie.77.d: "Long has the Rhein been home of revolutionary idealism and for good reasons. Rich in coal and steel and strategically situated along the Rhein river, the Rheinland became the nerve of Prussian and then German industrial might but also one of the biggest tragedies the Workers have known. Thousands of people were brought down from the countryside to work day-and-night through the bone in factories that had little to no safety just to be paid a meager salary, while on the other side the Bourgois class enriched itself and became decadent and corrupt. Yet the Rheinish worker toiled onthrough-and-through and when the world was set ablaze in 1914 he went over the trenches from the desert of the Levant to the muddy trenches of the Somme where his blood watered down the battlefield, and what were the results? The occupation of his homeland by the French and the re-enslavement of his class once more. Well, we say no more! No more shall the German Rheinish worker labor and die for nothing! We shall bring them the liberation that they earned and we shall kick those reactionary frogs out of Germany once and for all !"
valkyrie.77.a: "I want a general strike over the country !"
valkyrie.77.b: "Lets fund a rebellion to get rid of the French"
valkyrie.77.c: "War will solve this"

valkyrie.78.t: "Nationwide Paralysis"
valkyrie.78.d: "Everywhere the workers are rising up putting the country to a halt as the factories and bureaucracy grounds to a halt and demanding our government be dismissed a new one elected."
valkyrie.78.a: "Bend in"
valkyrie.78.b: "Call in the French"

valkyrie.79.t: "The Rheinland turned Red"
valkyrie.79.d: "The battle for the Rheinland has been won! Everywhere people are celebrating as the government of the Rhein dissolved itself and called for immediate elections, which have been won by the Socialists unsuprisingly. The French garrison, overwhelmed by the strike wisely decided to not aggravate the situation by firing at the popular crowds, instead they opted to retreat along the Sarrebruck-Lorraine line to reorganize. As diplomatic ties are re-establish and our troops mobilize in order to protect the Rheinland from a possible French counter-attack a question arises, should the Rhein be annexed into Germany proper or should it be allowed a degree of autonomy ?"
valkyrie.79.a: "We are all German Workers"
valkyrie.79.b: "They have earned their autonomy"

valkyrie.80.t: "The Rheinland turned Red"
valkyrie.80.d: "It seems that the French have no bounds for their cruelty, as the workers rose up to claim their rights the puppets of France called in the garrison, which then proceeded to crush the strike through force. Hundreds lay dead, martyrs of the revolution. Their only crime, was demanding human decency."
valkyrie.80.a: "Rage, Rage against the dying of the light."

valkyrie.81.t: "Spartakus Uprising"
valkyrie.81.d: "Everywhere in every major industrial sector, thousands of workers armed themsleves with guns which were undoubtebly given by Germany, it is unclear how the situation is but we must strike hard and fast lest we loose the country."
valkyrie.81.a: "Rush in as many people as you can !"
valkyrie.81.b: "Its a trap ! Starve them out !"

valkyrie.82.t: "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences"
valkyrie.82.d: "The good thing about a densely packed oppressed industrial zone with a water canal and a bunch of angry Germans with socialist tendencies is that first, funding them is extremely easy, second, They don't lack the motivation to use the weapons we give them and, third, any attacking force that storms through these industrial zones will find themselves ambushed and will be faced with high casualties and weeks of siege warfare. The French in their infinite wisdom had chosen the later and have since they paid dearly for their choice. As the tanks unable to move down the narrow streets where picked off by insurgents who started to throw bottles of flaming alcohol down their engines. As for their infantry, the bloody house-by-house combat resulted in high death counts among their troops, which were unfamiliar with the environment and this new type of war. Faced with no choice other than retreat or continual attrition warfare which would be difficult to explain to the weary home populace, the military has chosen the former and have since then retreated along the Alsace-Saarland line. With the Rheinland properly secured now, we could either re-arrange a new government loyal to the revolution or directly incorporate the region back into Germany proper."
valkyrie.82.a: "Loyalty and Strength earned them their autonomy"
valkyrie.82.b: "The Rheinland, was, is and will always be a part of Germany"

valkyrie.83.t: "The revolution defeated"
valkyrie.83.d: "It appears that the French are not as idiotic as we thought. Instead of rushing into the cities to reestablish order, the French encircled and starved them out one by one before assaulting the weakened positions avoiding the costly protracted warfare we hoped for. As the French strengthen their grip on the region following this defeat, it seems as the future of the Rhein will not change from the inside..."
valkyrie.83.a: "One way or another the revolution will spread West"

valkyrie.84.t: "The Second Brest-Litovk Pact"
valkyrie.84.d: "One cannot describe the strange atmosphere of a room full of German and Soviet military officers, diplomats and bureaucrats smiling and exchanging handshakes and drinks. These people were, no more than 20 years ago, cannon fodder fighting eatchother in a duel duel to the death for their Tzars and Kaisers. Its seems almost ironic that these two countries which were embedded in Monarchism became revolutionary states, casting, as Marx said, shadow and fear over the cruel slave masters of Europe who keep the Workers and Peasants classes enslaved, but not for long..."
valkyrie.84.a: "Our nations are now united in purpose"

valkyrie.85.t: "Germano-Soviet Exchange"
valkyrie.85.d: "With our new alliance with the Soviets being cemented a proposal has come forth from the USSR to open the borders with them, so that both our people may visit and learn from eatchother, spreading innovation and revolutionary thoughts which would keep the spirit of our nations alive by pumping fresh blood into aging institutions and bureaucracy. Nevertheless new ideas can also prove themselves to be dangerous and menacing to the established system..."
valkyrie.85.a: "Send the proposal"
valkyrie.85.b: "No, the Soviets may use this to their advantage"

valkyrie.86.t: "End of Fall Blau"
valkyrie.86.d: "With the end of the war against the Eastern European border states that kept us and the USSR political and economically isolated, a new age can now begin. Now that we share a massive border, socio-economic and military exchanges can be intensified and more aggressive foreign policy employed. It is a truth the capitalists must face now, both Germany and the USSR are no longer secondary powers to be ignored, they are contenders for the future European New Order. And when the storm that is covering Europe shall dissipate, only the Red flag will remain, floating across all of its capitals." 
valkyrie.86.a: "Kamaraden, play the International !"

valkyrie.87.t: "Birth of the Comecon"
valkyrie.87.d: "Due to our ideological differences with the capitalist West, we may find ourselves running out of important resources like rubber or oil which are crucial for our aeronautical and mechanical industry in case of a major European war. That is why we and the Soviets have decided to integrate our respective economies as they are quite complementary, as we possess the heavy industry and they, the natural resources to keep it running. Such union will not only protect us from starvation, but also improve our industrial output substantially providing us the edge we so desperately need in defeating our numerous enemies.."
valkyrie.87.a: "A toast to our Soviet Comrades !"

valkyrie.88.t: "Germano-Soviet RnD Cooperation"
valkyrie.88.d: "The Soviets altought cooperative at first glance and willing to partake in an alliance with this new Socialist Germany of ours, are still showing some remorses and skeptism due to our old, almost antique, rivalry that got the better of our people for almost two centuries. That is why, in a sign of good faith we have elaborated a treaty of mutual technological exchange that will affect, in-Extremis, the fields of mechanized and armoured vehicles as both our countries have invested large resources into them."
valkyrie.88.a: "What do you mean exactly by slopped armor ?"

valkyrie.89.t: "The Scandinavian Problem"
valkyrie.89.d: "It is clear that the situation of Germany in Europe is growing bleaker as the days goes by, with our aggressive diplomacy, we have set off much of the continent against us, be it the French, Soviets or British, cutting off much of our access to the raw materials and precious resources our war machine desperately needs to operate. That is why we have no other choice but to go North. The weaker Scandinavian countries are an easy target for Germany's military might as their so called neutrality prevents them from holding any meaningful ally, alternatively we can strong arm them into trading with us and use their neutrality as a shield against any power who would want to cut off our trades throught acts of war."
valkyrie.89.a: "The Scandinavians cannot be trusted."
valkyrie.89.b: "Lets force them to trade with us."

valkyrie.90.t: "Northern Crisis"
valkyrie.90.d: "War has struck the Scandinavian peninsula! The British empire has declared its objective to occupy the Norwegen coastline to bar any possible militarization of Norway's fjords into naval bases that would threaten the Royal Navy's dominance of the North Sea, while the USSR has invaded Finland with the intention of protecting both Leningrad and its interests over the Northern Baltic region. It is clear that the strikes are designed to preemtively neutralize Germany's expansion to Scandinavia and the exploitation of its resources. Something must be done, and quickly!"
valkyrie.90.a: "We must get to them before the others do!"


valkyrie.91.t: "The Watch on the Rhein"
valkyrie.91.d: "Humiliation, shame, rage. Those are the emotions that every German fells since the end of the Weltkrieg, when the first French troops advanced into the sacred heart of Germany. Millions of unknown soldiers dead, buried in the trenches, unavenged. Their mothers and nation left undefended, famished and impoverished pleading for the mercy of the new conquerors who ripped apart the very earth and sent to their puppet masters its riches for more than a decade... until now. Germany pushed on, survived and prospered, with its spirit of implacable justice renewed, with a new generation bent on washing. Germany pushed on, survived and prospered, with its spirit of implacable justice renewed, with a new generation bent on washing the honour of their fathers and with a new state wishing to reclaim its place among the world ! Yes, the German eagle is on the hunt once more and it will take what is rightfully his."
valkyrie.91.a: "Rheinland or War !"
valkyrie.91.b: "Let us strike when the time is right."

valkyrie.92.t: "A Night at the Docks"
valkyrie.92.d: "The Rhein river is an impeccable clock one might say, busy and full of life at day, and calm and tranquil at night.\nOf course, exceptions can't be made, can they? Everyone would notice that, for example, under the cover of darkness, a few dozen wooden boats filled to the brim with guns, grenades and ammunition are making it across the Rhein river into the dockyard of Köln, especially the workers of said dockyard, who, of course, are honest and incorruptible, or the discipline French garrison which never does drink heavily while on duty. None of that never happened and this debriefing never took place."
valkyrie.92.a: "[CLASSIFIED]"

valkyrie.93.t: "The Forgotten"
valkyrie.93.d: "Many a soldier and officer are left in the Rheinland, impoverished, persecuted, with no goals nor purpose, in a society that wants to forget them and their days of wars. But we do not forget, we do not forget those who served and those who betrayed us, the crimes of ones and the sacrifices of others. And now that the time is right and that Germany is reborn, we called on our brave veterans to serve one last time."
valkyrie.93.a: "And this time we shall make it to Paris !"

valkyrie.94.t: "Veterant's rebellion"

valkyrie.95.t: "War"
valkyrie.95.d: "The Rheinish rebellion we fomented successfully rose up in the area around Cologne and managed to push back the French garrison from the province. Yet, the French didn't retreat from their positions around the Rhineland, instead they opted for a counter-attack with the intent of crushing the rebellion and solidifying their grip once and for all, hearing the formal radio calls for support some of our regular army troops crossed the undefended bridges along the Rhein river to reinforce their comrades positions, devolving the insurgency into a full blown war as brigades became corps, and corpsbecame divisions. With the first dead being counted and with public opinion heavily in favour of war, it seems that as of now we are at war with the French."
valkyrie.95.a: "Let's send these dogs to their mothers !"

valkyrie.96.t: "A War to End all Wars ?"
valkyrie.96.d: "It seems almost ironic that the powder keg of Europe might explode once more because of an ultimatum. How many men shall die? How many coffins shall return to Germany? How many children shall grow up without their fathers beside them? Such is the weight of war where man become a number, where casualties become statistics and where pain is drowns in oceans of blood. And yet our world marches on to it's death, unbeknownst to it, that the sins of our forefathers will forever keep us blind."
valkyrie.96.a: "Send the letter."

valkyrie.97.t: "The End of Peace"
valkyrie.97.d: "The French have taken it upon themselves to declare the war that was brewing ever since the end of the first Weltkrieg. There is no going back now, no sacrifices will be too big, no mission too difficult. We shall triumph or be dead trying."
valkyrie.97.a: "There will be no coming in Chrismas for many of us."

valkyrie.20001.t: "Hamburg Revolt"
valkyrie.20001.d: "The German worker of Hamburg have finally revolted and broke off the chains of their Danish overlords ! They are now begging us to join their rightful fight against them and have agreed to submit to the DSR's rule in exchange for our intervention."
valkyrie.20001.a: "What are we waiting for ? Attack !"
valkyrie.20001.b: "It is not in our intrest to intervene"

valkyrie.20002.t: "Peninsular War"
valkyrie.20002.d: "It seems that the time bomb that was the Danish Kiel Occupation finally exploded. With the workers taking arms against the Danes and with their presence being finally eliminated from Holstein we can at last march our own troops, crush the rebellion ourselves and secure Germany's rightful land."
valkyrie.20002.a: "Let us reclaim what is ours."
valkyrie.20002.b: "Over Kiel and far beyond it !"
valkyrie.20002.c: "Let us wait until the storm sets"


valkyrie.105.t: "German Pan-nationalists are marching on Vienna!"
valkyrie.105.d: "Thousands of Members of the Valkist Party of Austria are attempting to pressure and overthrow our government. Their forces are strong and determined but we must fight back against this coup at all cost."
valkyrie.105.a: "Protect the parliament building at all cost."

valkyrie.1051.t: "Our coup was successful!"
valkyrie.1051.d: "Our well planned coup which was executed by Ernst Kaltenbrunner yesterday is successful as the putschists were able to get control of Vienna and the surrounding areas. Having successfully arrested the whole cabinet, Kaltenbrunner declared himself Leader of the new Austrian Nation. Nobody really resisted him as Dollfuß’ reputation had been in free fall lately."
valkyrie.1051.a: "Excellent, prepare the Anschluss."
valkyrie.1051.b: "Excellent, lets keep Austria as a satellite."

valkyrie.1052.t: "Our coup in Austria was defeated!"
valkyrie.1052.d: "The well planned coup led by Ernst Kaltenbrunner was smashed today as the Putschists were caught in a firefight with Austrian Policemen and Members of the Army. After securing most of Vienna the Putschists were trying to march onto the Austrian Parliament, where the Austrian Government under Dollfuß was currently holding a conference, were caught in a firefight with Members of the Austrian Police and loyal soldiers of the Austrian Army, which with reinforcements coming in from St. Pölten was able to repel the Putschists and disperse them. Dollfuß has officially denounced Germany for trying to undermine the Austrian Government. He called the coup the Final Insult by Germany."
valkyrie.1052.a: "We will not tolerate this!"
valkyrie.1052.b: "Maybe we should bide our time…"

valkyrie.1053.t: "The Pan-nationalists have won."
valkyrie.1053.d: "After a quick series of battles with the police and the army the Valkists lead by Ernst Kaltenbrunner have taken the Parliament building and are now in control of Austria."
valkyrie.1053.a: "We must flee to Paris."

valkyrie.106.t: "Austria asks for help"
valkyrie.106.d: "The Austrian people have asked us to support them against the threat of Germany. The Treaty of Versailles clearly states that a union between these nations is illegal and without the buffer of Austria the entire Balkan peninsula might fall to the Valkist menace. It may be in our best interest to stand up against the threat of Germany now instead of later when they've gathered more strength but many of our own generals warn us that our army may not be ready to fight a major war currently."
valkyrie.106.a: "We must not let Germany pick apart Europe one by one."
valkyrie.106.b: "Why die for Dürnkrut?"

valkyrie.107.t: "France refuses to support us"
valkyrie.107.d: "Our delegation in France has reported that their government has no intentions to stand up for Austria against the German threat. We've wasted too much precious time on the French and now the German ultimatum is nearing its deadline. It seems we will have no choice but to bring up every able-bodied man to arms and fight to defend our homeland."
valkyrie.107.a: "Hurry to arms!"

valkyrie.108.t: "Austria has ignored the ultimatum."
valkyrie.108.d: "Yesterday we gave the pitiful Austrian nation the offer to join the greater German empire. As generous as our offer was it seems that Austrian politicians, blind to the desires of their people, have chosen to ignore it. No nation in Europe has spoken up against our claims to the alpine territory and as such we will not need to worry about any foreign intervention as our armies march into Austria."
valkyrie.108.a: "We will be dining in Vienna by the end of the week"

valkyrie.139.t: "Germany demands German Bohemia"
valkyrie.139.d: "German nationalists in the north of our nation have caught the attention of Germany. The Valkist regime now demands we surrender these regions to them. Our nation is in no place to fight the Germans. If we are to have any hope of keeping these regions we must petition France to protect our sovereignty."
valkyrie.139.a: "We can't risk a war. Give Germany what they want."
valkyrie.139.b: "Surely the French will stand with us."

valkyrie.140.t: "Bohemia wants our help."
valkyrie.140.d: "The government of Bohemia has asked our nation to give them protection against Germany. The Valkist government is using German nationalist sentiments in German-Czechia as an excuse to annex these regions. it's clear that this is just the first step in a plan to fully dismantle the weak Bohemian nation but we may not be able to give the land locked nation any real support in the case of war."
valkyrie.140.a: "France will stand up for her friends."
valkyrie.140.b: "Why die for Děčín?"

valkyrie.141.t: "France has abandoned us"
valkyrie.141.d: "Our delegation in France has reported that their government has no intentions to stand up for Bohemia against the German threat. We've wasted too much precious time on the French and now the German ultimatum is nearing it's deadline. It seems we will have no choice but to bring up every able bodied man to arms and fight to defend our homeland."
valkyrie.141.a: "Hurry to arms!"

valkyrie.142.t: "Bohemia has ignored the ultimatum."
valkyrie.142.d: "Yesterday we demanded that the pitiful Bohemia nation allow their German people to return to their true home. As fair as our offer was it seems that Bohemia politicians, blind to the desires of their people, have chosen to ignore it. No nation in Europe has spoken up against our claims to the territory and as such we will not need to worry about any foreign intervention as our armies march into Bohemia."
valkyrie.142.a: "At last, we shall reclaim our birthright"

valkyrie.254.t: "Germany demands we yield to their rule"
valkyrie.254.d: "After carving our nation apart the ever vengeful Germans still demand more from us. Nothing less than our total capitulation will satisfy Berlin. It is clear that the Entente has no interest in saving Poland. If we resist we must do it own our own."
valkyrie.254.b: "Poland Is Not Yet Lost"
valkyrie.254.a: "We must avoid bloodshed"

valkyrie.255.t: "Poland surrenders"
valkyrie.255.d: "The government in Warsaw wisely choose to peacefully surrender to us. Poland is now the newest region of Reichpakt."
valkyrie.255.a: "Sometimes threats are mightier than the Panzer"

valkyrie.256.t: "The Polish will fight back"
valkyrie.256.d: "Despite our overwhelming stregth the foolsih politicians in Warsaw have stubbornly decided to resist us. We will crush their armies in days an intergrate their country by force."
valkyrie.256.a: "No one shall stop Germany"

valkyrie.243.t: "Germany offers us a place in the Reichpakt"
valkyrie.243.d: "German diplomats have flown into Minsk today to offer our nation an alliance. We are vulnerable position in Eastern Europe. A single Soviet offensive could wipe our state of the map so it may be in our best interest to gain the support of Germany but we must also be wary of letting Valkist influence taint our culture."
valkyrie.243.a: "Our security trumps any onjections"
valkyrie.243.b: "We should not associate with Germans"

valkyrie.244.t: "Belarus joins Reichpakt"
valkyrie.244.d: "Seeing the value of a German guarantee of protection the government in Minsk has agreed to join Reichpakt. Hopefully this will send a message to the Soviets and secure our place as the dominate power in Europe."
valkyrie.244.a: "One step closer to Moscow"

valkyrie.245.t: "Belarus refuses to join Reichpakt"
valkyrie.245.d: "Despite the existential risk the Soviets are to the survival of their nation, the government of Belarus has refused to join Reichpakt. When the time comes we may need to find other ways to deal with Belarus."
valkyrie.245.a: "Neutrality won't save Belarus"

valkyrie.246.t: "Germany offers us a place in Reichpakt"
valkyrie.246.d: "German officials have met with us today in Kiev to discuss a possible alliance between our nations. Our position in Eastern Europe is critacally vulnerable. A single Soviet offensive could wipe us off the map so it may be in our best interests to gain German support but we must be wary of Valkist influence tainting our culture."
valkyrie.246.a: "Our security trumps all other matters"
valkyrie.246.b: "We must not fall into German hands"

valkyrie.247.t: "Ukraine has joined Reichpakt"
valkyrie.247.d: "Seeing the value of a German guarantee of protection the government in Kiev has agreed to join the Reichpakt. Hopefully this will send a message to the Soviets and secure our place as the dominate power in Europe."
valkyrie.247.a: "A toast to our Ukrainian friends"

valkyrie.248.t: "Ukraine refuses to join Reichpakt"
valkyrie.248.d: "Despite the existential risk the Soviets are to the survival of their nation, the government of Ukraine has refused to join the Reichpakt. When the time comes we may need to find other ways to deal with Ukraine."
valkyrie.248.a: "Neutrality won't save Ukraine"


valkyrie.10001.t: "The Fate of Poland"
valkyrie.10001.d: "After a quick campaign into Poland, German troops have surrounded the Polish capital of Warsaw. After a night of heavy shelling German troops were able to take the city with only minor opposition. Now that our Eastern territories are secured we can focus on France or push onto the Soviet Union. The fate of Poland rests on our hands."
valkyrie.10001.a: "Let us form a friendly government."
valkyrie.10001.b: "Poland is lost, forever."

valkyrie.10002.t: "The Fate of Poland"
valkyrie.10002.d: "With the capture of Warsaw and the liberation of Poland, the road to connect with the Soviet Union is now open and further campaigning in the East is now possible. Nevertheless, to secure our logistics a lasting solution must be found Poland, lest we loose control of it when our armed forces are occupied elsewhere. Altough, the Polish people have proven to be reactionaries many times in this last decade, their revolutionary spirit is still very much alive and the organization of a Polish Socialist Republic is possible and preferable. Nevertheless, we can also take a safer rout and establish a lasting military occupation until we deem the time to be right for autonomy."
valkyrie.10002.a: "Let us start a lasting friendship with Poland !"
valkyrie.10002.b: "The Poles can not be trusted, unfortunately."

valkyrie.10003.t: "The Fate of Ukraine"
valkyrie.10003.d: "Wunderbar ! At last Ukraine is in our hands and the German eagle is soaring over much of Eastern Europe ! With our position against the barbatic soviet assured, we must now turn to oversea the internal affairs of this borderstate. We could establish an administation with collaborators to prove to the population that we benefactors unlike the Soviets, or alternatively military rule could be maintain to root out Socialist sympathisers."
valkyrie.10003.a: "Let the Ukrainians have autonomy."
valkyrie.10003.b: "You know what Ukraine means ? It means Borderlands !"

valkyrie.10004.t: "The Fate of Ukraine"
valkyrie.10004.d: "With the end of the corrupt bourgeois Ukrainian government and with the Red flag flying over Kiev. A question comes to mind, what shall we do with the people of Ukraine ? One one hand, we could create a native socialist government that we can work with to destroy the reactionaries and insure collaboration. On an other we can do it our self while preparing the region for true Socialism that is yet to come."
valkyrie.10004.a: "The Belarussians must be allowed to live free..."
valkyrie.10004.b: "Unfortunately, the situation doesn't allow it."

valkyrie.10005.t: "The Fate of Belarus"
valkyrie.10005.d: "Wunderschönen ! With the capture of Minsk and the destruction of Belarussia by our hands, we have put ourselves in a prime position to defend or attack the Soviet Union. Nevertheless the Belarussian people must be swayed to our cause, lest the nation turns against us in our final our, on other note, military repression might do the job as well as collaboration."
valkyrie.10005.a: "Let them have autonomy."
valkyrie.10005.b: "White Russia ? What kind of name is that ?"

valkyrie.10006.t: "The Fate of Belarus"
valkyrie.10006.d: "With the end of the corrupt bourgeois Belarussian government and with the Red flag flying over Mink. A question comes to mind, what shall we do with the people of Belarus ? One one hand, we could create a native socialist government that we can work with to destroy the reactionaries and insure collaboration. On an other we can do it our self while preparing the region for true Socialism that is yet to come."
valkyrie.10006.a: "The Belarussians must be allowed to live free..."
valkyrie.10006.b: "Unfortunately, the situation doesn't allow it."

valkyrie.10007.t: "The fate of Denmark"
valkyrie.10007.d: "The Baltic is the life line of Germany, without it our nation would starve. Control of it is paramount if we want to reassert our dominance across Europe. The Entente has shown no interest in protecting Denmark and as such we will have free reign to dictate our will on the tiny nation. Many plans have been sent forward. What should we do?"
valkyrie.10007.a: "Our ambitions in Scandinavia aren't finished yet."
valkyrie.10007.b: "Establish dominion over Denmark."
valkyrie.10007.c: "Direct annexation is preferable."

valkyrie.10008.t: "The fate of Denmark"
valkyrie.10008.d: "The Baltic is the life line of Germany, without it our nation would starve. Control of it is paramount if we want to reassert our dominance across Europe. The Entente has shown no interest in protecting Denmark and as such we will have free reign to dictate our will on the tiny nation. Now that the Red flag is flying over Copenhague, plans have been set forward. What should we do?"
valkyrie.10008.a: "The revolution will unite Scandinavia !"
valkyrie.10008.b: "The Scandinavians aren't ready for it."

valkyrie.10009.t: "The fate of Italy"
valkyrie.10009.d: "Now that we've liberated Italy we have to decide what to do with the land and its inhabitants. One one hand we might decide that the Italian people are mature enought for Socialism, as so we will form an autonomous Italian council that will be charged of Italy, on the other the Italian people may not still be ready for self-rule and as so we will continue military occupation for their best intrests."
valkyrie.10009.a: "Italy must be allowed Self-rule, lest it turns against us."
valkyrie.10009.b: "The time is not right for it."

valkyrie.10010.t: "The fate of Italy"
valkyrie.10010.d: "Now that we've conquered Italy we have to decide what to do with the land. We can form a puppet government under cooperative Italian general, Rudolfo Graziani, cutting the cost of prolonged occupation. We could also, however, continue our occupation and conquer the peninsula entirely."
valkyrie.10010.a: "Fine, I'll rather not wage a war against angry peasants."
valkyrie.10010.b: "I came, I saw, I conquered."

valkyrie.10011.t: "The fate of France"
valkyrie.10011.d: "Our victory over the French Republic has left us in control of nearly all of western Europe. 40 million non-Germans now live under our occupation and are certainly not accepting of it. Two plans have been drafted on how to deal with the unrest. We can establish either establish a puppet regime in Paris closely watched by our military garrison. This nominal autonomy might calm down some of the unrest or at a minimum make it their issue instead of ours but many officers also believe that we should let our military directly keep a watch over the citizens of France and use any force necessary to keep them in line. While the second option would be expensive it could be more effective."
valkyrie.10011.a: "Fine, let the French breath..."
valkyrie.10011.b: "France ? Freedom ? What nonsense is that ?"


valkyrie.10012.t: "The fate of Britain"
valkyrie.10012.d: "After the defeat of the United Kingdom we have a choice on what we should do with the British. We could keep a central government, consisting of all both Britain and Ireland. We could also choose to weaken the English and divide the islands into England, Scotland, and Ireland. Our final option would be to occupy it and use its industrial centers to fund our war effort."
valkyrie.10012.a: "Puppet Britain"
valkyrie.10012.b: "Divide the Isles"
valkyrie.10012.c: "Continue military occupation"

valkyrie.10013.t: "The Fate of Russia"
valkyrie.10013.d: "Our country occupies vast swaths of formerly Soviet territory in Eastern Europe. It's is clear to most commanders that we can't continue a military government over such a large territory forever. Creating a civilian administration for Russia under our own supervision would help alleviate administrative maintenance of this region."
valkyrie.10013.a: "Order the creation of a civilian government"
valkyrie.10013.b: "Never shall the Russian bear live again !"

valkyrie.10014.t: "The Fate of Zentraleuropa"

POLITICS_ADAM_DRESSLER_DESC: "An orphan, a Veteran, an Austro-German, Dressler led a very difficult life. Following the Great War, Dressler would find his way to the DNVP and then become one of their most notable and charismatic speakers. Dressler would attempt to assist a DNVP-led coup in 1923, only to be crushed and forcibly detained. During his time in prison, Dressler wrote a fanatic novel titled 'Mein Deutschland das Siegreiche', a novel detailing revenge against the Western Powers and destruction of the Soviets in the East. The novel would become incredibly popular. Following a case that proved Dressler's imprisonment unlawful; he was released from prison and was greeted by hundreds of supporters. Dressler would then build up support for his newly founded Valkistische Volkspartei Deutschlands and then run for office in 1932. Dressler narrowly lost to Otto Wels, declared the results fraudulent, and then lead a coup to bring down the Wels' Government. Dressler declared himself leader of Germany in the Reichstag, something the Entente responded to with hostility due to their belief of the 1932 election being legitimate. Dressler declared a snap-election which led to an overwhelming VVD victory. With it, the Entente reluctantly accepted the belief that the 1932 elections were fraudulent. Since then, Dressler has rearmed Germany from the shadows, prepared to enforce Germany's vision for Europe through Military Might in coming years."
### Military Descriptions
GER_Erwin_Rommel_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 15th, 1891, in Heidenheim an der Brenz, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gIn 1910, Erwin Rommel joined the Württemberg Army, being promoted to lieutenant in 1912 within his infantry regiment following his studies at the Danzig war academy. Rommel would then be assigned as a company officer within his regiment until 1914 where he would be transferred to a field artillery regiment. The outbreak of the Great War however would see Rommel back in his old regiment, serving with distinction and being awarded with an Iron Cross as a result. Following this, Rommel would be switched to a mountain fighter battalion, serving in Italy, Romania and on the Western Front. Here, Rommel would earn the Pour le Mérite for his actions and as a result be retained within the atrophied army. Initially, Rommel would serve as a company commander, being deployed against anti-government forces throughout the turbulent first years of the Republic. In 1924, Rommel would be assigned to a staff position at the battalion level, soon being moved to company chief within the same regiment. In spite of his performance however, Rommel failed the military district exam, being unable to enter the general staff. Nevertheless, Rommel would be made a teacher and inspector at the Dresden Infantry School, beginning his treatise on infantry tactics derived from his experience in the Great War. In April 1932, Rommel would be promoted to major, his last promotion before the rise of Dressler. Rommel would then be made the battalion commander in 1933, not long after being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935.§!\n\n§YNotes: Erwin Rommel has a close relationship with Adam Dressler, viewing him as the man destined to lead Germany back to her rightful place in the world. As such, he has been rapidly promoted and is likely to side with the Führer in any dispute."
GER_Maximilian_von_Weichs_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 12th, 1881, in Dessau, Province of Brandeburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gDespite being the son of a Prussian cavalry officer, Maximilian von Weichs joined the Bavarian Army as a flag cadet in 1900. Serving in a cavalry regiment, Weichs would quickly be promoted to ensign and then lieutenant in 1902 after a short stint at the War Academy. Weichs would then return to his regiment as a squadron officer and then regimental adjutant. After further training, Weichs would qualify for the general staff in 1913, during which he was promoted to senior lieutenant in 1911. By the outbreak of war in 1914, now-captain Weichs would initially be made chief of headquarters of the Bavarian Cavalry Division, followed by further work in the general staff for which he earned several awards for. After Germany’s defeat, Weichs would remain in the army unlike many of his comrades, serving as general staff officer in the few remaining cavalry units. Weichs would be promoted to major in 1921, four years after which he was sent to Ohdruf as a military instructor. In 1928, Weichs would be promoted to lieutenant colonel and made cavalry regimental commander. Weichs would continue to rise the ranks, being promoted to colonel in 1930 and then major general in 1933 following Dressler’s rise to power. This would land Weichs the command of the first tank division set up following Germany’s repudiation of Versailles. Most recently, Weichs would rise to the rank of lieutenant general in 1935, signalling the continuing expansion and development of the Heer.§!\n\n§YNotes: An aristocrat and with connections to figures sympathetic to the Young German League, it can be assumed that his sympathies lie with them - though Weichs himself seems unlikely to mutiny against the Valkist government."
GER_Ludwig_Beck_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gJune 29th, 1880, in Biebrich, Province of Hesse-Nassau, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gHaving graduated with excellent scores, Ludwig Beck would join the Prussian army as a flag cadet in 1898. Soon, Beck would be promoted to lieutenant the next year, being sent to the War Academy in 1908. Beck would then be promoted to senior lieutenant in his first year at the academy, returning to his old artillery regiment as an adjutant. In 1912, Beck would be sent back to Berlin, serving in the general staff and rising to the rank of captain in 1913 as a result. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Beck would officially join the general staff, serving on several different fronts as a general staff officer. By the war’s end, Beck would reach the rank of major and have earned several awards for his performance. Remaining in the army after Germany’s defeat, Beck would be shuffled between several divisional staffs before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1923 and attaining the position as a divisional head for secret general staff training. Beck would then receive several more staff positions, serving with and as the chief of staff of several different divisions. In 1927, Beck would rise to the rank of colonel and become acquainted with the rising Valkist movement whilst a regimental artillery commander. Despite considering his resignation following his defence of infamous Valkist officers, Beck would remain in the army. Shortly after, he would then begin work on modern army service regulations, attaining the rank of major general in 1931. After further positions as artillery leader and division commander, Beck would be promoted to lieutenant general at the end of 1932. Soon enough, Beck was granted the role as chief of the Troop Office - making him the effective chief of the general staff. Most recently, Beck was promoted to general of artillery in 1935, with his status as one of the most senior commanders in the army being unquestionable.§!\n\n§YNotes: Whilst Beck has described the rise of Dressler as ‘the first ray of hope since 1918’, Beck’s opinion of the Valkist cause has soured sharply since then. With many connections to the Young German League, there is little doubt where Beck’s allegiances lie."
GER_Paul_Hausser_desc: "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gSeptember 13th, 1880, in Brandenburg an der Havel, Province of Brandenburg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gHailing from a cadet school, Paul Hausser joined the army in 1898, rising to the rank of lieutenant early the next year. This would be followed by Hausser serving as an adjutant at both battalion and regimental level as well as a stint in the War Academy, leading to his promotion to senior lieutenant in 1909. In 1913, Hausser would then be made captain after he was sent to the general staff the previous year. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Hausser would serve on both the front and in the general staff, ending the war as a major with several awards. Hausser would then return to Germany following her defeat, fighting Polish troops in the east until 1920. Initially assigned as a first general staff officer, Hausser would then be deployed to further staff roles where he would be promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1922. Hausser would then remain in his post for five years until 1927, when he was promoted to colonel and made regimental commander. In 1930, Hausser would be made infantry leader and shortly after major general. However, he would not keep this rank for long as Hausser left the Reichswehr in 1932, opting to join the TST.

Having earned the Iron Cross for his bravery, Dietrich would still be discharged from the army and subsequently serve in the Freikorps where he aided in the brutal suppression of the communist uprisings following Germany’s defeat. Having joined the Freikorps Oberland, Dietrich would have a short police career starting from 1920 until 1923 when the Ludendorff putsch that he claimed to support failed. Dietrich would then go on to make a living through whatever means he could do so, along the way making acquaintances and eventually becoming friends with the leader of the Valkist movement - Adam Dressler. Now part of Dressler’s inner circle, Dietrich would begin to chauffeur him around during public events, eventually being inducted into the TST as a TST-Standartenführer. This would lead to Dietrich eventually gaining better career prospects, becoming a member of the Reichstag and bodyguard of Adam Dressler. With Dressler placing his trust in Dietrich, Sepp, as he was usually nicknamed by Dressler, would aid Dressler on his march on Berlin and be the man in-charge of the Munich TST. With the creation of proper TST divisions, the now-Führer Adam Dressler hence saw fit to place Dietrich in-command of the units; even though Dietrich has never undergone any military training in his life beyond that of a mere soldier.§!\n\n§YNotes: Fanatical and loyal, Dietrich’s position as one of Dressler’s personal favorites has not endeared him well to many of Dressler’s political allies.

After publishing a history on the tactical and operational capacities of the German naval forces during the Great War, Raeder would return to the spotlight as he was appointed the inspector of the naval education system.

Deisenhofer would then move on to study chemistry in Munich, soon changing his studies from chemistry to law at the end of 1929. Deisenhofer would then shuffle between universities, first in Munich, then in Rostock and finally in Würzburg where he would pass his traineeship exam in 1934. By this time, Deisenhofer was greatly familiar with the Valkist movement, joining the TST in 1930. Gaining repute within the TST, Deisenhofer would become a full-on commander of a TST company, quickly rising the ranks of the TST as he would soon become a regiment commander in 1935. Here he remained, seemingly unable to continue rising the ranks of the Prussian-dominated army. However, the rise of the TST has propelled him all the way to generalship, marking him as one of the youngest generals in the army.§!\n\n§YNotes: In spite of his involvement with the TST, Eduard Deisenhofer has yet to receive his doctorate which is said to be “impressive”. With Deisenhofer’s generalship, some suspect that the doctorate will have to be partly completed in the field."

He would be promoted to ensign before the end of the year, becoming a lieutenant not long after in 1906. Hoepner would remain in his regiment until he was called to Berlin to train in the general staff, being promoted to senior lieutenant just before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. At war’s start, Hoepner would see action in the field as an orderly officer, earning several awards and a promotion to ride master in 1915. Hoepner would thus be transferred to a post in the general staff, serving as a company commander. From 1916 onwards, Hoepner would serve in the general staff as an officer for special use, becoming a quartermaster at war’s end. Following Germany’s defeat, Hoepner would remain in the provisional Reichswehr as a squadron leader of a cavalry regiment in Prussia. Once the Reichswehr had been officially formed, Hoepner would be transferred to another cavalry regiment until 1921 when he was sent to the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin. Hoepner would continue as a captain in the inspection staff of the cavalry, becoming a general staff officer for another cavalry division in 1923. In 1927, Hoepner would be promoted to major and change position to serve in one of the military districts that year as an officer. In 1930, Hoepner would become a battalion commander and then a regimental commander in 1932 following his promotion of lieutenant colonel. Hoepner would continue to serve as the chief of staff of several military units, being promoted to colonel in 1935 as a result of the Reichswehr continued expansion following Dressler’s rise.§!\n\n§YNotes: As a cavalry officer, Hoepner is a staunch advocate for mechanization and armored warfare.

In 1917, Carl-Heinrich would then be sent back to the Western Front, receiving numerous awards in this time. Due to Germany’s defeat, Carl-Heinrich would witness the German Army be cut down massively, being one of the few officers who remained in the shrunken provisional Reichswehr. Initially assigned as an officer in a brigade, Carl-Heinrich would become a divisional staff officer following the creation of the Reichswehr.

By 1911, Blomberg would be promoted to captain, continuing to serve in the general staff all the way to the Great War’s start. During the Great War, Blomberg would serve as a general staff officer, initially serving as a company commander and then first general staff officer, rising to the rank of major as such in 1916. Having earned several awards during the war like the Pour le Mérite, Blomberg would continue to serve in the army following Germany’s defeat. Initially commanded to Berlin, Blomberg would serve in the Reichswehr Ministry, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel and shortly after becoming divisional chief of staff the next year. Blomberg would then remain at this post until 1925, when he returned to Berlin to become chief of the army training department. Soon, Blomberg would receive a massive jump in post as in 1927, Blomberg would become chief of the Troop Office, making him the secret head of the general staff and also major general. However, Blomberg would not last long in this position as the clique of Kurt von Schleicher would soon have him ousted over field exercises near the Rhineland, resulting in Blomberg’s de-facto exile to East Prussia. Now lieutenant general, Blomberg would serve in East Prussia until 1932 when he would be called back to Berlin following the dramatic rise of Dressler. Having become very agreeable to the Valkist cause due to his chief of staff Walter von Reichenau, Blomberg would be appointed Reichswehr Minister that year and begin the process of valki-fication that continues until now.§!\n\n§YNotes: Blomberg has tasked himself with the role of ensuring that the army aligns fully with the Valkist revolution, believing that only through total war can Germany come out on top."

List would afterwards begin to manage the Dresden Infantry School, rising to the rank of major general in 1930 and then lieutenant general just two years later. During this time, List would become one of the most senior officers in the army. With Dressler’s rise and the ensuing rapid expansion of the military, List would become commander of the Dresden military district, becoming a division commander. List would soon be promoted to general of the infantry and gain command of an army corps - being one of the most well-respected senior officers in the army.§!\n\n§YNotes: Whilst List himself may not have much care for the Valkist coalition and its brutish allies, the many attempts by anti-Valkist opposition to turn him has failed - securing his place in the new Reich."

In 1900, Fritsch would rise to the rank of lieutenant and soon after he would be sent off to the United Artillery and Engineering School for a year. Following this, Fritsch would serve as an adjutant until 1907 when he went to Berlin for general staff training. During his training, Fritsch would rise to senior lieutenant, beginning his service in the general staff in 1913. Soon, Fritsch would be promoted to captain just before the Great War broke out. During the war, Fritsch would serve as a general staff officer, being made major in 1917 and receiving several awards as well as shrapnel in the head for his service. Following Germany’s defeat, Fritsch would remain in the army, initially serving as a first general staff officer before heading to Berlin to serve in the Reichswehr Ministry. Whilst he served as a consultant, Fritsch would become a confidant of the Reichswehr chief, Hans von Seeckt, serving in the reconstruction and reformation of the initially destroyed Heer. In 1922, Fritsch would receive a command alongside a promotion to lieutenant colonel, becoming the chief of staff of the Reichswehr division based in East Prussia. Soon enough, Fritsch would be made chief of the army department in the Troop Office, rising to the rank of colonel in 1927 and receiving command of an artillery regiment afterwards. Fritsch would then continue to rise the ranks, becoming major general in 1930 and then lieutenant general two years later after receiving divisional command. Not long after, Fritsch would be caught up in the chaotic rise of Dressler, becoming a candidate for the chief of army command after former chief Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord fled following Dressler’s purge of Schleicher’s allies and loyalists. With the conservative high command refusing to accept the fervent Valkist Walter von Reichenau as their commander, Fritsch would soon be made chief of army command as well as a subsequent promotion to general of the artillery.§!\n\n§YNotes: Fervently anti-semitic and anti-communist, Fritsch is highly conservative in most of his views and thus aligns very strongly with the Young German League."

In 1928, Guderian would be sent to the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin, where he continued to push for armor primacy, a concept that he had developed over the past years. Guderian would then be assigned further staff roles, serving as an inspector of motorized troops and rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1931 followed by colonel in 1933. Following Dressler’s rise to power, Guderian was granted command of Germany’s new panzer divisions as the preeminent head of the armor advocates in Germany.§!\n\n§YNotes: With an ambivalent view towards the Valkist movement, his Prussian convictions make his loyalty to the Führer clear.

At the start of the Great War, Dietl would see action at the front, being wounded in August of 1914 and receiving several awards for his actions. In 1915, Dietl would be made a battalion adjutant, being promoted to senior lieutenant that year.

Having earned several awards for his service in the Baltics, Prieß would return to the shrunken army in Germany, serving in the cavalry as a sergeant. Whilst this would have been a rather uneventful career, with his retirement in 1931 to join the civil service seemingly marking the end of his military career; the rise of Dressler would change that.

There, he would work as an estate owner and farming administrator, becoming a local leader of the German settlers in Austria. Following a brief stint with the Austrian valkists, Krüger would find that farming in Austria had become infeasible and thus returned to Germany in 1934.

When BASF merged to form IG-Farben, Eicke would continue along in the new company, becoming a security commissioner by 1926. With the rise of the new Valkist movement, Eicke would soon join the rapidly growing movement with whom he shared much common interest.
